#post-cataclysm
There are very long tunnels connecting most of even the moderately sized cities to protect travelers from the horrors in the [[The Wastes]].
ones between large cities are larger to provide space for large-scale transportation and trading
smaller cities might have smaller tunnels to them from a big city, but they are not as well cared for or patrolled.

very few cities/towns that are not connected to a tunnel, because otherwise only a select number of people would be able to travel to and from the city (strong people that are prepared to travel in the Wastes or fight horrors)
