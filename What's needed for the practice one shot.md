**25-01-2026: More playtesting - rest of level one**

- Restarted rolling initiative right before the [[Barkspawn Sleeper]] encounter
- Everyone lived this time, but the Scribe had to be stabilized by a health potion
- Ran to a cave to let the Scribe recover
- As we were getting ready to continue, a [[Barkspawn Tyrant]] fought with two figures, who dropped the chains of the creatures they were holding
- The two creatures ran toward the cave, so we ran away, luckily unnoticed
- We ran to a building that used to be a mill
- Went into the house. There is something there
- It was two [[Wastewalker]]
- Fought, the scribe went down and back up, the scout and brawler went down too.
- The [[Entangle]] spell was clutch here
- Everybody lived. Barely

**26-01-2026: Playtest level 2**

- We will roleplay the long rest
- Level up to level two
- added [[Resources/Potion]] and [[Unstable Mixture of Chaos]] and others to the [[Items.base]]

- Crossed the river
- Came across an abandoned settlement
- Investigate the [[Reliquary]], finding another health potion, a vial of pitch black liquid, a flask with pink viscous liquid, a pair of boots (that make the scribe's amulet buzz when close to it), a pouch with 45 gold, and a ring
- A tall lanky figure is coming towards the Reliquary
- We began combat against some glowing bois and those lanky guys IIRC

	- *(how late were you up jajaja)*
	- Well, I got in bed around 2:30. Fell asleep around 5. Should have just kept working on this, or read lolol

**28-01-2026**

**James**
- added [[Lord of the Wastes]] page
- updated [[Rogalth, The Dread Visage, Lord of the Bone Road]]'s page

![[Pasted image 20260131000806.png]]

**03-02-2026: Playtesting level 3 - the final encounter?**
- Scouted out the destination
- [[Scribe]] prepared a lot of stuff
- snuck in as they were starting that ritual
- Fought, it went well. Again [[Entangle]] was super useful
- Radical fails made the rune activate right at the end
- Running from the [[Mantic Knight]]
- Got lost in the wastes for 5 days

- Thoughts
	- Radical failing adds another level of storytelling. Like when the [[Scout]] was outside the window and failed the [[Insight]] roll, that led to the [[Whispering Angels]] starting their ritual

**05-02-2026**
- 15 [[Resources/Arrow]] in [[Items.base]] view
- 25 [[Component]] and where they come from for us to start working with
	- along with rarities in [[Items.base]] -> [[Component]] view

**06-02-2026**
- 33 [[Waste Environments]]
- More [[Component]] (27)
- [[Waste Environments]] view in [[Sai Yoxis.base]] sorted by named, unnamed, commonality, danger, and size
- now with photos!

**06/7/8-02-2026**
- Lots of organizing.
- The best way that I've found for keeping the creature abilities visible on a creature's note is by (*gasp*)... keeping them in the note lol
	- Now, each ability/action is a `# Heading` instead of simply bolded
	- This allows it to be linked in the properties (like [[#Log]]) and visible in the bases. It's not quite perfect, but it's good enough for now.

> [!tip]+
> If you want to rename a creature's ability (or any heading that is likely linked to for that matter), be sure to right click on the heading and rename it, otherwise it won't auto-update the links to it

**10-02-2026**
- Finished [[Ancestry]] abilities
- Worked on [[Class]] abilities
- #todo Flesh out [[Condition]] and [[Damage Types]]
	- [[Fear (Condition)]], [[Bleed (Condition)]], [[Poisoned (Condition)]], [[Weakened (Condition)]], [[Inebriated (Condition)]], [[Restrained (Condition)]]
	- [[Mantic (Damage)]], [[Poison (Damage)]], [[Slashing]], [[Bludgeoning]], [[Piercing]], [[Fire]], [[Acid]]
