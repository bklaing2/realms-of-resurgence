## Coalesce
As a bonus action, begin gathering furomancy around a single point near yourself. Use an action to either throw it within a range of 30ft or explode it centered on yourself. Each turn you spend your bonus action focusing on gathering furomancy increases the damage done by the spell by 1D6 up to a max of 5D6. The spell must be used on the turn it reacher max charge.

## Furocraft
As a bonus action, mold furomancy into a solid form of one of: shield, dagger, short sword, longsword, or javelin. The object stays as long as you spend your bonus action focusing on it. If it leaves your hand for more than one turn or you don't focus on it the object evaporates back into latent furomancy.

### Radiation Fail Outcome #todo


## Cage #name-needed
As an action, create crystal pillars of furomancy out of the ground in at a point you can see within a range of 30ft. These crystals may take two forms. They can be many smaller and sharper crystals spread out over 15ft, damaging any creatures in the area for 3D6 and making it difficult terrain. Or they can be fewer larger crystals centered on a creature, damaging it for 2D6 but also forming a cage around it, restraining the creature. The crystals disappear if you don't spend your bonus action focusing on it.

### Radiation Fail Outcome #todo 


## Furopull #name-needed 
As a reaction, grab the tethers of the [[Latent Radiation in Wastes]] and pull a creature that is within 15ft of you and is about to be hit with an attack, yanking them 5ft out of the way of an attack. This yank reduces the damage they receive by your furomancer level.

### Radiation Fail Outcome
The tethers that be yank too hard and knock the creature prone, taking full damage of the attack and putting them in a more dangerous position for future attacks.
`I feel this is too punishing, that would really suck as the guy getting pulled. I think they should just get knocked prone - B`


# Tier 2 Spells


## Teleport  #todo
As an action, teleport any creature you can see within 60ft to any area within 60ft of you.

### Radiation Fail Outcome #todo  
The target is teleported in the opposite direction.

## Finger of Death #name-needed
As an action, beam a line of furomantic energy directly into a creature you can see within 30ft, dealing 6D6+20 furomantic damage to the creature.

### Radiation Fail Outcome  
The spell spreads out into a 15ft cone, dealing 3D6 furomantic damage to any creature within its area.


## Dominate Horror 
As an action, roll to control a horror you can see within 60ft. On a success, you gain control of the horror and can give it a command as a bonus action on your turn. At the end of your turn, roll to check if you keep control of the horror.

### Radiation Fail Outcome
If you get a radiation fail when attempting to dominate a horror or keep control, the horror targets you and immediately gets to take an extra turn.


## Time Bubble #name-needed
As an action, push all latent radiation away from you in a 10ft sphere. The flow of time is greatly increased inside the bubble and any creature within immediately gains 1D4+2 extra turns. Any projectile exiting the bubble stops at the edge, keeping its momentum. After all turns have been taken, resolve everything outside the bubble. Additionally, any rolls within the bubble do not require the radiation die, as the latent radiation has been pushed back.

### Radiation Fail Outcome #todo  
Just a brainstorm, but I'm not a fan of this - B
hmm yea, we can think of something better - J
The radiation is instead pulled towards you in a 5ft sphere. Any creature within its radius loses one turn.

# Brainstorm
This planet has very dangerous and unpredictable magic (which they call Furomancy and the people who do it Furomancers) it rarely does what they want it to do and it tends to overpower even the simplest of spells and reverse back on the user.


Everyone's gonna be first of all half casters and then also like I'm gonna be very specific like the magic spells and how many spells everyone has like, I don't think it's gonna be like oh yeah, like it even if you have like a Paladin technically a half cast or a Ranger they still have like a fair crap ton of spell slots and I'll listen to spell slots and I'm thinking the campaign was shorter cause the campaign won't go till 20 cause level 20 People in a grim dark fantasy horror realm wouldn't make any sense so I think I would only go up to like 10 as the max and those people would be like but that would definitely take some more work. I'm gonna I'm gonna do some work on it it's not just gonna be strictly DND. There's gonna be some differences in health points and differences and. But even like a level 10 range still gonna have like For sheriff spell spot since I don't want to I'll probably mess with that, but I would love for OK yeah I'm a paladin I have you know four spell slots. I'm a handful of spells and first of all there's gonna be some there's already gonna be some sort of like, especially in the cities. This is why I wanted to take this out this record this out so I can kind of think like this and you can hear it all and laugh at me dummy, but in the city like all magic is gonna have chances to not function because partly because of the magic that build it like hold the cities together and make sure that the darkness of the wastes stuff and get in that messes with the magic of the world as well and so magic in the cities won't be a sure thing you'll have to roll for that almost like on the wild magic table, but not exactly In the wastes, the magic will be a little bit more of a sure thing just because you're in the way you're in the waist. There's more like magic around you. You can tap into a little bit more but then I want it to be like OK if you have four levels of whatever it's called, you know whatever this is darkness is weight of darkness or whatever.
