the normal everyday monsters that live in [[The Wastes]], but these are truly powerful horrors. these have the power to level a large village or maybe small town if there are more than one.

these will stalk just anywhere (normally a little further from civilization) and are basically searching for something to eat. they sense the "anti-spark" inside the people of the world and hunt it down to eat it to survive or gain something or because of something pushing them to.

will break these down into different types of horrors. but these are like similar to what an ogre or hill giant would be in dnd - sometimes maybe controlled by a high sentience - low power creature, but can be rare. very animalistic in nature. they don't plan or have civilizations or anything. they live to eat and reproduce and kill

- a group of average people could never kill one of these - stories and legends tell of it occurring, but no one knows if they are true or not
- a group of well equipped and planned soldiers/travelers could kill one of these some of the time
- most veteran travelers will go days of travel out of the way of these creatures to avoid them, rather than fight them

2 forms - one grazing and "harmless" and one for hunting
takes a whole turn (or whatever) to change into their hunting form
allows for surprise attacks
