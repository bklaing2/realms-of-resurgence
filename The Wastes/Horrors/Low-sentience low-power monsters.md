the normal everyday monsters that live in [[The Wastes]].
these will stalk just anywhere and are basically searching for food. they sense the "anti-spark" inside the people of the world and hunt it down to eat it to survive or gain something or because of something pushing them to.

they occasionally will try to attack small villages to break in and get at the people living inside

will break these down into different types of horrors. but these are the grunts and the pawns and the un-thinking monsters. very animalistic in nature. they don't plan or have civilizations or anything. they live to eat and reproduce

- a group of average people could kill one of these
- a group of well equipped and planned average people could kill a group of these
- most not a large problem for veteran travelers - at least to escape or avoid (not always fight)

2 forms - one grazing and "harmless" and one for hunting
takes a whole turn (or whatever) to change into their hunting form
allows for surprise attacks
