the ruling monsters that live deep in [[The Wastes]]. these have the power to level/control a large city or maybe lay siege to a country if they felt like it. many of these have their own motivations and tend to control areas of [[The Wastes]] and may even do battle against other [[High-sentience high-power monsters]] of other areas to gain more territory.

these will have their own lair in which they live and have lesser horrors working for them and doing their bidding. they sense the "anti-spark" inside the people of the world and sometimes hunt it down to eat it if the draw is so big (someone very powerful in [[The Wastes]] or a large group of people).

will break these down into different types of horrors. but think of these as adult dragons in neighboring territories - not demi-god status, but not anything that anyone wants to ever have to deal with. - sometimes maybe in a mutualistic relationship with another [[High-sentience high-power monsters]] or [[Rulers of the Wastes]]. these things plan and have plans within plans and small civilizations unto their own of other smaller horrors that they allow to live and hunt in their territories.

- anyone average could not even consider surviving the sight of one of these, let alone a fight.
- an army of well equipped and planned soldiers could maybe kill one of these some of the time
- veteran travelers will not enter into the territories of the more powerful of these horrors, especially depending on how long their group has been out in [[The Wastes]] (the longer out there, the more enticing they are).
- some legendary travelers have stories told about how they have negotiated with one of these horrors or tricked them or played one against the other, but these stories have been mostly lost to time.
