## Time in [[The Wastes]]
The longer a person spends in [[The Wastes]], the more the latent energy and magic that are so present in them seep into the bodies of those traveling them. This latent magic is very difficult to control and does more to dampen and hamper a person and their "spark" than it does it "fill them with magic". However, after a certain amount of time in [[The Wastes]], a person may see certain effects that seem to empower some of their abilities when they are able to be "controlled".

Every long rest spent in [[The Wastes]], the players must roll to see if they are affected by [[The Wastes]] the normal amount, or if they are extra susceptible to it this day.

# Radiation Die
Every long rest, roll a D20 and a radiation die
The radiation die increases with each level of [[Latent Radiation in Wastes]]. If the D20 is lower than the radiation die, a wastes counter ticks up, increasing the likelihood that a horror finds you. However, if the D20 is the same number as the radiation die, the counter decreases by X amount. Maybe the current level of radiation?
