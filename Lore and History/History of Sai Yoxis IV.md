# History

## Eras of Sai Yoxis 4
### Pre Cataclysm
Life is middle-earth-like
Well advanced (but not as much as [[#Post Cataclysm]])
### The Cataclysm
People are rapidly mutating
New races evolving
Horrors emerging
Latent Furomantical radiation is causing strange effects
Survivors are just trying to survive
### Post Cataclysm
Thousands of years after [[The Cataclysm]]
The races of old have long since died out due to Furomantic radiation poisoning
The races that arose from [[The Cataclysm]] control the planet
They have advanced very far technologically
The horrors are confined to [[The Wastes]]


## Order of important events on Sai Yoxis 4
Feel free to veto any of this lol just spitballing

- Sai Yoxis was a fairly normal planet
- As time passed, races began to evolve. However, these were low magic races because of the weak nature of [[Neomancy]]
- They begin to advance, build civilizations, and start trying to harness Neomancy
- These experiments with Neomancy get out of hand, and lead to [[The Cataclysm]] and creation of [[Furomancy]]
- Latent Furomantic radiation filled the entire world from the [[The Cataclysm]]
- Most people living on the planet began to mutate from the excess of Furomantical radiation. Simultaneously, normal creatures rapidly evolved/mutated into sentient humanoid people. A small, lucky percentage of the population was unaffected.
- Those were hit with the blast were mutated into unimaginable, grotesque horrors.
- James' Grimdark campaign happens in the wake of [[The Cataclysm]]
- Many years later, the races that lived through [[The Cataclysm]] have died out (likely due to it) and new races have evolved more quickly due to the leftover radiation
- Present day, races like the [[Mushroomfolk]] have advanced to beyond space travel
