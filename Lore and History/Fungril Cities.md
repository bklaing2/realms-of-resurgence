#sai-yoxis/iv/post-cataclysm 

in general - from google doc:
each city is ruled independently from each other. while there is a prime emperor who is technically above all, he/she rarely actually has any bearing on the other cities outside the capital. this is because the people are used to not being able to travel and they are used to being ruled by their own minister prime in their own city. occasionally the prime emperor will make laws and pass them down, but there is only a small chantry in each city to carry out those laws. it’s very possible that the city decides to ignore them and do what they will.
