the planet has excelled in technological advancement and has developed very highly advanced tech, weapons, and vehicles. by the present time of Mazmorras, they have succeeded in space travel, but have not yet reached FTL ship travel. recently, they have developed ways of traveling to other planets by way of teleportation. they were able to travel to other planets in their system by normal space travel and were able to gather information and resources to find ways of sending a person’s atoms elsewhere in the universe. it doesn’t have infinite reach yet, and it isn’t always predictable or even functional, but it is enough to move a few agents around the universe in the solar systems near Sai Yoxis 4. About 12 years ago, they found the correct coordinates and other circumstances needed to key into Mazmorras. they have been slowly but surely learning what they can about the world and the people that live there and the technology that they currently have.
