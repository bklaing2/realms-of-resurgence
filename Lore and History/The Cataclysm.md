[[Furomancy]] was always a point of frustration for the people of Sai Yoxis 4. As civilizations grew and technology advanced, the one thing holding them back was furomancy. The leaders of [[The Main Ancient City]] gathered the best furomancy researchers and tasked them with the impossible: harness furomancy.

Decades passed.

Then a century.

Then two.

Finally there was a breakthrough, and the researchers knew they were on the verge of being able to bend furomancy to their will. They were too blinded by the sun, too near success, to see that their hubris was their downfall. From the precipice of greatness befell the greatest disaster. A furomantical explosion originating from the research laboratories shook the planet.

[[The Main Ancient City]] was hit the hardest. Everyone in the city was immediately disintegrated by sheer furomantical force. The shockwave carried waves of furomantical radiation for hundreds of miles.

Those outside the worst of it arguably had it worse. Massive doses of furomantical radiation covered half of the planet. The few survivors, those immune to the radiation for whatever reason, looked on in horror as everyone around them began to change. Limbs elongating, heads splitting in half, skin becoming an inky black... These were the horrors that now ruled this world. Most of the survivors were quickly consumed by their friends and family. Few were able to escape.

The radiation also caused many small, hardy creatures to quickly evolve to sentience. Namely [[Fungrils]], [[Slug People]], [[Mice People]], [[Lizard People]], and [[Cockroach People]]

Smaller amounts of furomantical radiation spanned the rest of the globe. The damage was done, though, and Sai Yoxis 4 was forever changed.[[Furomancy]] was always a point of frustration for the people of Sai Yoxis 4.
