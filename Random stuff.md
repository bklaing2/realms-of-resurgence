Modular monster creator. A few options here... Have a few roll tables for the appearance, abilities, etc of a monster that the DM is trying to make. They can roll to randomly create a monster, or use the tables to manually create their own monster.

We will need:
For the actual monster creator system, the roll tables will be:
- abilities (short description)
- two descriptors of the monster
	- what they're made out of (plant, bone, etc)
	- body shape (mammalian, humaniod, etc)
- Personality (aggressive, ambushy, etc)
- Potentially radiation fail list. Roll on that, pick one that matches the vibe, or create your own

- A handful of monsters at each tier completely statted out (abilities, radiation fails and everything)
- Similar to daggerheart, include a table with a range of stats for different tiers
	- Monsters in tier 1 do 3d4 + x to Y damage. Anything above shouldn't be included in that tier
- A list of example radiation failures


For combat abilites, either the save dc (e.g. 10 + level) or amount of damage will be tied to the level

Sai Yoxians or Fours in their own solar system
sai yoxis 4 has a brown dwarf as it’s “sun” so even during the day it doesn’t get super bright and it only has 1 moon, which is large but not very bright because of the brown dwarf. the brightest it gets during the day is like a dim dusk that we have here on earth. and that’s at midday.


### Voice memos
OK, so like here's what I'm thinking so obviously I'm thinking about psychosis as more of a Grimm dark like very, very dark very difficult to survive you know horses rather than monsters all so we were talking about this.


333 days in year
18 hours in a day
long rest 6 hours
short rest 30 minutes
closer to "sun" (than earth is)
revolving about the same speed
rotating faster
9 months of 37 days each
6 weeks of 6 days in every month + 1 special day at the end. holiday - culturally important


# Brainstorm
## Abilities
- Once per long rest, can remove a radiation die from the roll
- Every race/class has a roleplay and exploration ability
- Exploration ability

## Using furomancy in the wastes
- If you fail your radiation die roll, the result instead applies to a DM effect table (2 - 23). The effects get worse the higher the number (e.g. 2-7 is level 1)

if you fail 3 "death saving throws" then you go unconscious and cannot be revived until you leave [[The Wastes]]. when you are revived, ???

Monsters are weakened when they are outside of [[The Wastes]]

no moon

3 types of damage: Physical, Elemental (can include fire and all the others - but it will all just fall under the sign of elemental), and Furomantical


Neomancy
Duomancy
Ethermancy
Furomancy
