# Experiences?

Basically like daggerheart experiences

# Scars and Death Saving Throws

Each character starts with a capacity of 1 death saving throw failure, and need two successes to get back up. If they die, they can choose to take a scar. This will permanently mark off their one death saving throw failure capacity. If they go down again and die, they are dead dead

Scars can potentially give a plus to the mantic score

# Augment increase intrinsic mantic charge capacity

# Casting spells using external mantic charges

If (your intrinsic mantic ability score OR the number of mantic charges you use) is less than half of the required mantic charges needed for the intended action, then you have to make a roll for it or the (antimantic inverse OR radical fail outcome) occurs even outside of the wastes


# Mantic abilities all use mantic charges

Consolidate abilities that use Mantic energy (fighter empowered charges, spell slots, runic charge slots) under the umbrella term of "Mantic Charge". Everything will be called a Mantic Charge, and anything that consumes a Mantic Charge can be powered by anything else that produces a Mantic Charge. Therefore, a Fighter can pump three Mantic Charges into a Mage to allow them to cast a tier 3 Spell on their turn

An enemy where you have to roll X or lower to hit - it would be harder to hit the higher level you are

# Monster creator

Modular monster creator. A few options here... Have a few roll tables for the appearance, abilities, etc of a monster that the DM is trying to make. They can roll to randomly create a monster, or use the tables to manually create their own monster.

We will need:
For the actual monster creator system, the roll tables will be:
- abilities (short description)
- two descriptors of the monster
	- what they're made out of (plant, bone, etc)
	- body shape (mammalian, humaniod, etc)
- Personality (aggressive, ambushy, etc)
- Potentially radiation fail list. Roll on that, pick one that matches the vibe, or create your own

- A handful of monsters at each tier completely statted out (abilities, radiation fails and everything)
- Similar to daggerheart, include a table with a range of stats for different tiers
	- Monsters in tier 1 do 3d4 + x to Y damage. Anything above shouldn't be included in that tier
- A list of example radiation failures

# Combat

For combat abilites, either the save dc (e.g. 10 + level) or amount of damage will be tied to the level

Ancient devices in the Wastes that can be activated by mantic energy



Sai Yoxians or Fours in their own solar system
sai yoxis 4 has a brown dwarf as it’s “sun” so even during the day it doesn’t get super bright and it only has 1 moon, which is large but not very bright because of the brown dwarf. the brightest it gets during the day is like a dim dusk that we have here on earth. and that’s at midday.


### Voice memos
OK, so like here's what I'm thinking so obviously I'm thinking about psychosis as more of a Grimm dark like very, very dark very difficult to survive you know horses rather than monsters all so we were talking about this.


333 days in year
18 hours in a day
**long rest 6 hours**
**short rest 30 minutes**
closer to "sun" (than earth is) (sun is an old dwarf brown star)
revolving about the same speed
rotating faster
9 months of 37 days each
6 weeks of 6 days in every month + 1 special day at the end. holiday - culturally important


# Brainstorm
## Abilities
- Once per long rest, can remove a radiation die from the roll
- Every race/class has a roleplay and exploration ability
- Exploration ability

## Using furomancy in the wastes
- If you fail your radiation die roll, the result instead applies to a DM effect table (2 - 23). The effects get worse the higher the number (e.g. 2-7 is level 1)

if you fail 3 "death saving throws" then you go unconscious and cannot be revived until you leave [[The Wastes]]. when you are revived, ???

Monsters are weakened when they are outside of [[The Wastes]]

no moon

3 types of damage: Physical, Elemental (can include fire and all the others - but it will all just fall under the sign of elemental), and Furomantical


Neomancy
Duomancy
Ethermancy
Furomancy


What if all the vaporized people were temporally/dimensionally displaced

Leaking furomancy
