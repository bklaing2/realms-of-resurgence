# Abilities

## Passive

- **Slow Fall:** Rather than taking fall damage from 10 ft and up, bird-folk only start taking fall damage from 30 ft and up. And they can roll a DC 15 - level [[Athletics]] check to halve the damage. #brainstorm 

## Active

- **Screech:** 15 ft cone in which a bird-folk may screech and any creatures within that range must make a DC 8 + level ~~[[Fortitude]]~~[[Constitution]]? #james-check  saving throw or become stunned until the end of the bird-folk's next turn. Stunned creatures cannot move, automatically fails [[Fortitude]] and [[Finesse]] saving throws, and attack rolls against them have advantage. #brainstorm 

## Skill Proficiency

talon - advantage if attacked from the air
