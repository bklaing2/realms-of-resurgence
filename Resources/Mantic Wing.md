***Great Horror***

[[The Wastes]]

perception: +4
stealth: +8

# Mantic Creation
Any attacks from non-mantical or magical origin do half damage on this creature.

# Multiattack
Per turn the flyer can make one [[Bite]], one [[Claw]], and one [[Tail]] attack per turn

# Bite

+8 to hit
5 ft range
3d6 + 5 [[piercing]] damage

# Claw

+8 to hit
5 ft range
2d6 + 5 [[slashing]] damage

# Tail

+8 to hit
10 ft rang
2d8 + 5 [[bludgeoning]] damage

# Screech

_recharges on a 5-6_
The flyer lets out a piercing screech that manipulates the mantic energy in the area around them. It forms into a line 25 ft long and 10 ft wide and blasts outward from the mouth of the flyer. Each [[creature]] that is caught in the line must make a [[Finesse]] check DC 17 or take 8d6 + 8 damage, half damage on a success.

# Proximity Radiation Fail

When a PC rolls a radiation fail within 25 ft of the flyer shifts into ethereal mantic energy and can move its movement speed immediately. The flyer is invisible in this form and will reform into physical mantic energy at the start of its next turn, with advantage on its first attack.
