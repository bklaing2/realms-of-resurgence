# Description
A broad, chipped handaxe made from dull grey metal that seems to absorb moisture.

+1 to hit
handaxe - 1d6+2 mantic slashing (light, thrown 30/120)
[[Intuition]] to hit
[[Mantic]] for damage

Wounds made by this axe cause blood to not cut properly and creatures wounded by this weapon (and that have blood) are given the [[Bleed (Condition)]] and take 1d4 points of damage at the top of their turn for 1 minute.

Prolonged holding of this weapon leaves the wielder's lips cracked and bleeding, forcing them to drink double the water they would normally drink.
