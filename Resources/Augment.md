As an action, inscribe a circle on the surface. Upon activation, choose an attribute to augment. Creatures within the circle receive an additional 1d4 + [[Scribe]] level to that attribute while the circle is active.

You can choose from the following attributes:

- HP
- AC
- Damage
- To hit

# Antimantic Inverse

Instead creatures receive minus 1d4 + Scribe level to that attribute
