[[The Wastes]]
**AC**: 13  
**HP**: 25  
**Speed**: 25 ft (hover)
**Fortitude**: +3  
**Mantic**: +4  

**Passives**:  
**Fear aura:** Creatures within 15 ft of The Absent must make a Fortitude saving throw DC 13 at the start of their turn. Failure will cause the creature to be scared of The Absent for 1 minute (disadvantage with it in sight and must move full movement **towards** The Absent) can reroll saving throw at the start of subsequent turns. On a success, cannot be affected by another Absent's aura for a full day.

**Actions**:
**Multiattack**: (2) The Absent makes 2 (shortsword) attacks each turn.
# Attacks:

## Shortword:
+3 to hit  
5 ft range  
2d6 + 4 mantic damage

# Proximity Radical Fail Outcome
When a PC within 25 ft rolls a radiation failure, The Absent can teleport to their marked creature (if no creature is marked, then they may teleport to their paired [[Attending, The]]), and then can immediately make one free Shortsword attack.

If a PC rolls a radiation failure within 25 ft of both this The Absent AND its paired [[Attending, The]], they instead teleport to each other and fuse, combining HP and taking The Absent's AC and other physical stats, but now no longer has to roll focus checks after hits and can use the Absent's multiattack AND the Attending's eyebeam each turn.
