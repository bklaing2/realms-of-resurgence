# Mage slayer

If a [[Creature]] expends a [[Mantic Charge]] within 15ft of the Dreadmarshal, it may take a reaction to move to that creature and make an attack against them, after the [[Mantic Charge]] is used, but before the creature ends their turn.

# Warhammer

+4 to hit
5 ft range
2d6 + 4 [[Bludgeoning]] damage

# Proximity Radical Fail Outcome

When a PC within 15 ft rolls a [[Radical Fail]], the cultist sucks up some of the mantic energy and on their next hit, expends their 2 [[Mantic Charge|Mantic Charges]] into their attack, dealing an extra 3d6 damage to the attack. If a second Radical Fail occurs, they gain back these charges, but cannot expend them until the 3rd radical fail, should one occur, and so on.
