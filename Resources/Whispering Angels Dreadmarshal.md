**Mage slayer:** If a creature expends a [[Mantic Charge]] within 15ft of this a Dreadmarshal, it may take a reaction to move to that creature and make an attack against them, after the [[Mantic Charge]] is used, but before the creature ends their turn.

**Actions**:
# Attacks:

## Warhammer:

+4 to hit  
5 ft range  
2d6 + 4 bludgeoning damage

# Proximity Radical Fail Outcome:

When a PC within 15 ft rolls a radiation failure, the cultist sucks up some of the mantic energy and on their next hit, expends their 2 [[Mantic Charge|mantic charges]] into their attack, dealing an extra 3d6 damage to the attack. If a second Radical Fail occurs, they gain back these charges, but cannot expend them until the 3rd radical fail, should one occur.
