[[The Wastes]], [[Lord of the Wastes]] 

# Travel the Bone Road

Every [[Creature]] that starts their turn within 20 ft of Rogalth must make an [[Intuition]] check DC 13. Failures pop out of material existence and are forced to walk the Bone Road for the entire round. When they return, they take 2d6 + 6 mantic damage and appear exactly where they were at the start of the round. The Bone Road is a road of suffering and torture and the creature must walk it and see all that has been done to people who have been previously killed by Rogalth. Successes do not walk the Bone Road, or take damage.

# Multiattack

Rogalth makes 3 attacks (2 [[#Greatstaff]] attacks and 1 [[#Mantic Grab]] attack) each turn.

# Greatstaff

+8 to hit
15 ft range
3d8 + 8 [[#bludgeoning]] damage

# Mantic Grab

PC must make a [[Mantic]] check DC 16 or take 2d10 + 12 [[Mantic (Damage)]] damage and Rogalth heals for half the amount. PC takes half damage on a success and Rogalth does not heal. On a failure, the PC is also grappled by the hand and is held up into the air. Rogalth can hold two creatures at once, more if he is no longer holding his weapons. [[Creature|Creatures]] grappled by Rogalth have disadvantage on the saving throw.

# Legendary Actions
*3 per round*

Can use them to cast a spell immediately after an initiative block, can use as many LAs as he wants to add MC equal to that into the spell cast, or to cast a higher level spell.

# Proximity Radical Fail Outcome

When a PC within 60 ft rolls a [[Radical Fail]], Rogalth immediately takes control of the bones that are buried beneath his lair/area of [[The Wastes]] and can cause them to break through the floor and either grab [[Creature|Creatures]], block off different areas of the map, or lift people up to different heights in a room. [[Fortitude]] saving throw DC 14 to break out of the bone grapple (if failure, the creature is just restrained) and the bones have an AC of 10 and a section has 12 HP if a creature wants to try to break out of a section. Vulnerable to [[Bludgeoning]] damage.


# Description

[[Gargantuan]] skeleton horror with 4 arms. legs are so long and heavy that he drags himself everywhere and doesn’t walk. Looks like an old skeleton with a long billowing cloak type thing and a large staff in his one hand. A crown of bones and candles are on his head with jewelry around his neck and on his fingers. Each part of his body is made of the bones of hundreds of different creatures, all working together to move and work him.

Every 25 years, the skeleton and therefore “personality” in control of Rogalth changes. since he is an amalgamation of thousands of skeletons and bones, each one makes up different parts and aspects of him. therefore, throughout history, Rogalth has been different and made different agreements and relationships with others outside of his realm. his new controllers must follow the rules and agreements of the past ones in charge.  

## Shangnar
*currently in control*

A more peaceful version of Rogalth, was an academic in his past life and spends his days sending out his minions to explore and bring back artifacts and information for him. Would rather talk to adventurers who pass through his realm to learn of what is going on in the world than just kill them. Often sending them on quests for him in return for information, help, and powerful items. Still powerful and will show their power when called to or needing to, but tends to be easier to work with.  

## Dyd’ifa
*previously in control*

A weak, spineless version of Rogalth. He attacked [[Settlement]] for no reason and basically did not know what he was doing and made a bad name for them. A feared named for power is good. A feared name for mindlessness and stupidity is not. The rest of Rogalth managed to get him switched out before it was his time with the help of some adventurers, and the next controllers are doing their best to not have a repeat of that.  

## Gromsh
*will be in control next*

Warlord. Very powerful and scary and much more focused on spreading their realm and killing people. [[#Shangnar]] is worried about when he will take control (in 3 years)  

# Crech
*ancient famous controller*

Helped raise them to the title of [[Lord of the Wastes]] by building the bone road and spreading their realm. Every controller hopes to be remembered as he is.
