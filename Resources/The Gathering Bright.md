Normally the people "in-charge" of each village/town with the forward facing members of the cloth taking these positions. They lead the towns through string and constant monitoring. They listen to everything going in the towns and keep people in line with their nighttime visits and heavy pressure.

They are obsessed with bringing back the light to [[Sai Yoxis IV]]. They just go about it in all the wrong ways. Controlling the masses, experimenting on outriders with Mantic energy, and doing constant rituals to bring the light and push away the dark and horrors of the wastes.

In public, the upper members wear large, voluminous robes covering almost their entire bodies. Their facer are covered with a veil type thing made of stone and metal (like Jessica wears in Dune). Several of them carry metal staffs with carved heads that lie in their hands. Each of them always carries some sort of mantical light source - a glowing gem, a glass ball on a chain with a spark of fire in it, etc.

Carrying old tomes and scrolls with information from an old age, trying to find some scrap of something to help bring back the "gods" of old and the light.

Behind closed doors, things are very different. The members are quite mean and enjoy running towns and controlling the artifacts that are found in the [[The Wastes|Wastes]] for their own purposes.
