Normally the people "in-charge" of each [[Settlement]] with the forward facing members of the cloth taking these positions. They lead the towns through string and constant monitoring. They listen to everything going in the towns and keep people in line with their nighttime visits and heavy pressure.

They are obsessed with bringing back the light to [[Sai Yoxis IV]]. They just go about it in all the wrong ways. Controlling the masses, experimenting on outriders with [[Mantic]] energy, and doing constant rituals to bring the light and push away the dark and horrors of the wastes.

In public, the upper members wear large, voluminous robes covering almost their entire bodies. Their facer are covered with a veil type thing made of stone and metal (like Jessica wears in Dune). Several of them carry metal staffs with carved heads that lie in their hands. Each of them always carries some sort of mantical light source - a glowing gem, a glass ball on a chain with a spark of fire in it, etc.

Carrying old tomes and scrolls with information from an old age, trying to find some scrap of something to help bring back the "gods" of old and the light.

Behind closed doors, things are very different. The members are quite mean and enjoy running towns and controlling the artifacts that are found in the [[The Wastes|Wastes]] for their own purposes.

Their holy buildings are called [[Reliquary]], in which are built on top of and around the ancient burial sites of dead Lord's of the Wastes, deities, and other powerful beings. The left over power from these bodies is what protects Settlements from the horrors of [[The Wastes]].

**Titles and positions of their order:** #brainstorm 
- **Prime Continuum** (for the absolute leader of the GB and who will "hold all the 'Light' that the GB gather and ascend to be the one and only god of IV")
- **Hierophant** (leader of a [[Reliquary]] and [[Settlement]])
- **Pontifex** (full member of the clergy, but not a leader of a [[Settlement]])
- **Scriptors** and/or **Offerants** (apprentices and those becoming Pontifices)
- ***The Ones that Remember*** (general name for the GB)
- ***The Deep Learned*** or just ***The Learned*** (for a name that they call themselves within the GB)
- **Dawnmarked** (those created for the protection and furthering of the GB)
- **Wardens of the Light** (only in larger [[Settlement]]s, when protection or things are needed, but [[Dawnmarked (Bound)]] are not available or would be overkill. Regular waste-dwellers that work for the GB, not part of the clergy technically)
