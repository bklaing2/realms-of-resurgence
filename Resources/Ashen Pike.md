Pike - 1d6 + 2 mantic piercing (thrown 30/120)
[[Intelligence]] to hit
[[Mantic]] for damage

Creatures with at least one wound by this pike take 1 point of damage at the start of their turn. If they have multiple (up to 5) they take that much damage.

Wood shaft feels warm near mantic energy and wounds left by this weapon are covered in gray ashy dust.
If this weapon ever comes into contact with pure mantic energy, the holder immediately drops it and takes 2d6 fire damage.
