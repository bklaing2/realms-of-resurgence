[[The Wastes]]
**AC**: 11  
**HP**: 14  
**Speed**: 15 ft  
**[[Finesse]]**: +2  
**[[Mantic]]**: +4  
**Perception**: +3

**Passives**:  
Very good hearing, advantage on perception checks using their hearing.

**Actions**:
# Attacks:

## Claw:
+2 to hit  
5 ft range  
2d4 + 4 slashing damage

**Wail:**
*Refreshes on a 5-6*
As an action, the Wastewalker lets out a shattering wail that can be heard for miles around, and anyone within 50 ft makes a [[Fortitude]] saving throw DC 15. On a failure, they are stunned for 1 minute and can reroll the saving throw at the end of every subsequent turn. On a success, they take 1d6 + 4 mantic damage and are not stunned. Stunned creatures cannot move, get attacked with advantage, and take automatic critical hits when attacked with a melee attack.

# Proximity Radical Fail Outcome
When a PC within 25 ft rolls a radiation failure, the Wastewalker fills with mantic energy and becomes more physical than before (before being extremely ethereal). They now have new stats, shown below: passives and Wail are still the same, though full Wastewalkers will choose to attack twice rather than Wail.

# Updated Stat Block

**AC**: 10  
**HP**: +20 whatever the previous form had  
**Speed**: 45 ft  
**[[Finesse]]**: +4  
**Mantic**: +5  

**Actions**:
**Multiattack**: (2) A full Wastewalker makes 2 attacks (both claw) each turn. 
# Attacks:
## Claw:
+4 to hit  
5 ft range  
4d4 + 5 slashing damage
