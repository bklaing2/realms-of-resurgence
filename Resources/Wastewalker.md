[[The Wastes]], [[Component]]

# Passive
#needs/name 

Very good hearing, advantage on perception checks using their hearing.

# Claw

+2 to hit
5 ft range
2d4 + 4 [[Slashing]] damage

# Wail
*Refreshes on a 5-6*

As an action, the Wastewalker lets out a shattering wail that can be heard for miles around, and anyone within 50 ft makes a [[Fortitude]] check DC 15. On a failure, they are stunned for 1 minute and can reroll the saving throw at the end of every subsequent turn. On a success, they take 1d6 + 4 [[Mantic (Damage)]] damage and are not stunned. Stunned creatures cannot move, get attacked with advantage, and take automatic critical hits when attacked with a melee attack.

# Proximity Radical Fail Outcome

When a PC within 25 ft rolls a [[Radical Fail]], the Wastewalker fills with mantic energy and becomes more physical than before (before being extremely ethereal). They now have new stats, shown below: [[#Passive]] and [[#Wail]] are still the same, though full Wastewalkers will choose to attack twice rather than Wail.
