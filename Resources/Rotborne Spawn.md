# Battlefield Soldier

If within 60 ft of a [[Rotborne Overseer]], deals an extra 1d4 damage on every attack.

# Bile Spit

20 ft range
1d6 + 3 poison damage
5 ft radius AOE, every [[Creature]] inside must make a [[Finesse]] check or take the damage. Half damage on a success. 

# Proximity Radical Fail Outcome

When a PC within 35 ft rolls a [[Radical Fail]], the Rotborne Spawn immediately flies towards the PC who radically failed and attaches to their face. That PC is now blind (disadvantage on attacks and others have advantage to hit) and take 9 points of [[Poison (Damage)]] damage at the top of each turn. The creature must make a contested [[Fortitude]] check against the Spawn (who has a +0) as an action on their turn to remove the Spawn from their face.

# Description

Rotborne wander [[The Wastes]] searching for things to kill, eat, and scavenge. They live in small tents made of flesh in small camps of 2-8 Overseers and their entourages. Can be traded with occasionally, but often times will attack if they feel like they have the upper hand and the opposing people have something they want (or they are hungry).
