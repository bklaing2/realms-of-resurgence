# Proximity Radical Fail Outcome
When a PC within 20 ft rolls a radiation failure, the Rotborne Feral goes absolutely nuts and breaks off of their chain to attack the PC furthest from their original Overseer. When off the chain (whether by this or by the [[Rotborne Overseer]] dropping the chain) the Feral takes an extra bite attack each turn and goes after the player **furthest** from their original chain holder.


## Description
Rotborne wander [[The Wastes]] searching for things to kill, eat, and scavenge. They live in small tents made of flesh in small camps of 2-8 Overseers and their entourages. Can be traded with occasionally, but often times will attack if they feel like they have the upper hand and the opposing people have something they want (or they are hungry).
