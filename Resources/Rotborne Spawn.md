# Proximity Radical Fail Outcome
When a PC within 35 ft rolls a radiation failure, the Rotborne Spawn immediately flies towards the PC who radically failed and attaches to their face. That PC is now blind (disadvantage on attacks and others have advantage to hit) and take 9 points of poison damage at the top of each turn. The creature must make a contested Fortitude check against the Spawn (who has a +0) as an action on their turn to remove the Spawn from their face.


## Description
Rotborne wander [[The Wastes]] searching for things to kill, eat, and scavenge. They live in small tents made of flesh in small camps of 2-8 Overseers and their entourages. Can be traded with occasionally, but often times will attack if they feel like they have the upper hand and the opposing people have something they want (or they are hungry).
