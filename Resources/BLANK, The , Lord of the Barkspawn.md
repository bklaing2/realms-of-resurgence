# Attacks:
## Greatstaff:
+8 to hit  
15 ft range  
3d8 + 8 bludgeoning damage
## Mantic Grab:
PC must make a Mantic saving throw, DC 16 or take 2d10 + 12 mantic damage and Rogalth heals for half the amount. PC takes half damage on a success and Rogalth does not heal. On a failure, the PC is also grappled by the hand and is held up into the air. Rogalth can hold two creatures at once, more if he is no longer holding his weapons. Creatures grappled by Rogalth have disadvantage on the saving throw.

## Legendary Actions (3 per round):
Can use them to cast a spell immediately after an initiative block, can use as many LAs as he wants to add MC equal to that into the spell cast, or to cast a higher level spell.

# Proximity Radical Fail Outcome
When a PC within 60 ft rolls a radiation failure, Rogalth immediately takes control of the bones that are buried beneath his lair/area of the wastes and can cause them to break through the floor and either grab creatures, block off different areas of the map, or lift people up to different heights in a room. Fortitude saving throw DC 14 to break out of the bone grapple (if failure, the creature is just restrained) and the bones have an AC of 10 and a section has 12 HP if a creature wants to try to break out of a section. Vulnerable to bludgeoning damage.
