[[The Wastes]]

# Mantic Armor

When the knight is attacked by melee, the creature takes 1d4 [[Mantic (Damage)]] damage

# Multiattack

Mantic Knight makes 2 attacks (longsword and punch) each turn.

# Longsword

+5 to hit
5 ft range
3d8 + 6 [[Slashing]] damage

# Mantic Punch

+6 to hit
5 ft range
3d6 + 6 [[Mantic (Damage)]] damage

# Proximity Radical Fail Outcome

When a PC within 15 ft rolls a [[Radical Fail]], the Mantic Knight's armor fills with mantic energy and, at the start of it's next turn, a blast of mantic energy shoots out in a 15 ft cone. PCs in the cone make a DC 13 [[Finesse]] saving throw or take 5d6 mantic damage and 1/2 on a success.
