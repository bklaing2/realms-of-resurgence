# Description

As an action stomp. [[Mantic]] crystals emerge out of the ground at a point you can see within a range of 30ft. These crystals may take two forms:
1. Many smaller and sharper crystals spread out over 15ft, damaging any creatures in the area when cast for [[Mantic Damage]] damage and making it difficult terrain.
2. A few larger crystals centered around a creature, damaging it for half the [[Mantic Damage]] but also forming a cage around it, restraining the creature. The creature must make an [[Athletics]] saving throw in order to escape the cage.

The spell ends and the crystals disappear if you don't focus on it that turn.
