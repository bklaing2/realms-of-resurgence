# Description

As an action stomp. Mantic crystals emerge out of the ground at a point you can see within a range of 30ft. These crystals may take two forms:
1. Many smaller and sharper crystals spread out over 15ft, damaging any creatures in the area when cast for [[Mantic Damage]] damage and making it difficult terrain.
2. A few larger crystals centered around a creature, damaging it for half the [[Mantic Damage]] but also forming a cage around it, restraining the creature. The creature must make an athletics saving throw in order to escape the cage.

The spell ends and the crystals disappear if you don't focus on it that turn.
