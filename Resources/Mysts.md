Similar to the [[Blood of the Wastes|Blood]], they help connect the villages. They help bring people and items (many illegal) between villages. They are sometimes paid to go and find/pickup a newly discovered artifact.

They move in the darkness an tend to fight more often than [[Blood of the Wastes|Blood]] does, often times traveling in groups rather than alone.

They are called the Mysts because of the way they blend into the mists when they need to disappear.
