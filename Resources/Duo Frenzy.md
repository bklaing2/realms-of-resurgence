Choose your type of frenzy

1. Surge Frenzy: lasts shorter (like three rounds), but is much more impactful (crit on 17 or above, etc). After you rage you get a point of exhaustion or lose their action on the next turn or stunned for a round
2. Frenzy lasts longer, and can be a bit more utility. Can move points from one stat to another (or maybe get X extra points to distribute)
