# Proximity Radical Fail Outcome
When a PC within 40 ft rolls a radiation failure, the Gnawmite, immediately turns and rushes towards the PC that radically failed and dive bombs them, from the ground. PC makes a [[Finesse]] saving throw, DC 14, or take 2d6 + 2 damage. Successes take half damage. If more than 1 Gnawmite is within the 40 ft range, roll a d4 and that is how many "dive bomb" the PC.
