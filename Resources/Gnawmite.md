[[The Wastes]], [[Component]]

# Burrowing

Double speed while burrowing through the ground.

# Needle Shot

+4 to hit
20 ft range
1d6 + 4 [[Bludgeoning]] damage

*(Jumps out of the ground to shoot the creature it targets, it then lands on the ground and will re-enter the ground on its next turn)*

# Proximity Radical Fail Outcome

When a PC within 40 ft rolls a [[Radical Fail]], the Gnawmite immediately turns and rushes towards the PC that radically failed and dive bombs them, from the ground. PC makes a [[Finesse]] check, DC 14, or take 2d6 + 2 damage. Successes take half damage. If more than 1 Gnawmite is within the 40 ft range, roll a d4 and that is how many "dive bomb" the PC.
