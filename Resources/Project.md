# Description #todo 

As a quick action, you project a Mantic facsimile of your hands to a point you can see within 60 feet. The facsimile directly mirrors your hand movements and may perform any action that could be accomplished using only hands.

All actions performed through the projection are made with advantage, and any damage dealt by the projection gains [[Mantic Damage]].

Examples:
- Make a melee attack with advantage. The attack is funneled through mantic energy to may direct the attack at any creature within 60ft, damaging the creature for the *result of the attack* + [[Mantic Damage]].
- Looking through a window, use the projection to open a locked door.
