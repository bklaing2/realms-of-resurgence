A cult that makes its home amongst the villages and the [[The Wastes|Wastes]] of [[Sai Yoxis IV]]. Nasty and terrible people that are more horrors than humanoid anymore. They experiment with Mantic energy, the people of Sai Yoxis IV, and the horrors of the Wastes. They believe that the angels of a long dead deity whisper to them and tell them what to do and how to make the world like they want it to be like.
