# Description #todo

Once a day per boot, create a temporary platform of solid mantic energy under the boot. You can get an extra step off the platform

- Could maybe be recharged be a mage spending a spell of at least tier one, or with monk [[Mantic Charge|mantic charges]]
- Extra energy would wear off during a rest
