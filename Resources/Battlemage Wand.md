# Description #todo

Battlemage Wand - 1d8 [[Mantic]]
[[Intelligence]] to hit
[[Mantic]] for damage

much shorter range for up close and personal fighting

creature wielding this can choose to spend [[Mantic]] charges of their own to increase the damage (the d8 replaces the first d6 of the [[Mantic]] charges, but after that it increases normally with d6s)
