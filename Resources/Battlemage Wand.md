# Description #todo

Battlemage Wand - 1d8 mantic
intelligence to hit
mantic for damage

much shorter range for up close and personal fighting

creature wielding this can choose to spend mantic charges of their own to increase the damage (the d8 replaces the first d6 of the mantic charges, but after that it increases normally with d6s)
