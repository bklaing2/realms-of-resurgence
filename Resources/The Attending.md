[[The Wastes]], [[Component]]

# Stealthy

![[Stealthy]]

# Mark

As an action, The Attending can Mark a [[Creature]]. This creature now becomes the chosen target of its paired [[The Absent|Absent]] and gives it Advantage on that target when they are within sight of The Attending. The Attending must use its Quick Action on subsequent turns to focus on Mark and must make [[Mantic]] saving throws each time it is hit with a DC of the damage taken to maintain focus.

# Eyebeam

+4 to hit
40 ft range
1d8 + 4 [[Mantic (Damage)]] damage

# Proximity Radical Fail Outcome

When a PC within 25 ft rolls a [[Radical Fail]], The Attending can swap places with their paired [[The Absent|Absent]] via teleportation, and then can immediately make a free [[#Eyebeam]] or [[#Mark]].

If a PC rolls a radiation failure within 25 ft of both this Attending AND its paired [[The Absent|Absent]], they instead teleport to each other and fuse, combining HP and taking The Absent's AC and other physical stats, but now no longer has to roll focus checks after hits and can use [[The Absent#Multiattack]] AND the Attending's [[#Eyebeam]] each turn.
