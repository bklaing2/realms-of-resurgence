[[The Wastes]], [[Component]]

# Keen hearing and smell

Advantage on perception checks using hearing and smell

# Multiattack

Warped wolf makes 2 attacks ([[#Claw]] and [[#Bite]]) each turn. (Becomes 3 after a PC [[Radical Fail]])

# Claw

+6 to hit
5 ft range
2d6 + 6 [[Slashing]] damage

# Bite

+6 to hit
5 ft range
4d4 + 6 [[Piercing]] damage

# Mantacle

+9 to hit
10 ft range
4d6 + 3 [[Mantic (Damage)]] damage
Target must make a DC 13 [[Fortitude]] saving throw or be restrained, and the wolf cannot make another [[#Mantacle]] attack while a PC is restrained in this way.

# Proximity Radical Fail Outcome

When a PC within 15 ft rolls a [[Radical Fail]], the Warped Wolf immediately rips open their body more and the mantacles extend. (Unlocks Mantacle attack)
