> [!info]- Furomania Roll Table
>
> | Roll | Name | Effect   |
> | ---- | --- | -------- |
> | 1 | Protector | If within 5 feet of an ally, you can use a quick action to force an attack against them to target you, with disadvantage |
> | 2 | Surrounded Attack | If there are 2 or more enemies within 10ft of you, you have advantage on attacks and do an extra 1d4 of damage per enemy within 5ft |
> | 3 | Charge Attack | Double movement speed. For each 10ft you move in a straight line toward the enemy before attacking add 1d4 of damage and push the enemy back 10ft |
> | 4 | Displacement | Gain the [[Displacement]] cantrip until the Mania ends |
> | 5 | Bond | Use an action to bind with an ally. You can then use a quick action, or reaction when you or the ally are about to be hit, to swap places with them. You can use another action to move the bond to another ally |
> | 6 | Diverse Attack | If you attack more than 1 creature on your turn, use your quick action to connect them with Furomantic Energy. This throws them together, dealing 1d6 damage for every 5ft they were apart |
> | 7 | Shadow Clones | 3 clones of you form out of the surrounding Mantic Energy. Gain 1d6 per clone to your attacks. If you are about to be hit, you can use a quick action to sacrifice a clone to take the hit instead, destroying it |
> | 8 | Flight | Gain 30ft flying speed. If you attack from the air and land on the ground, do a 10ft AoE attack that deals 2d6 damage and has a chance to knock down enemies |

## ![[Brawler#Ability 2 needs/name todo]]

## Furomania

[[#Mania]] uses a d8 instead of a d4

braindump: give an ability to choose to add 4 to the furomania roll to get a better effect



Should opp attacks just be if you started the turn in their range?
