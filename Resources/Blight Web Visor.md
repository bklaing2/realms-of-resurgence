# Description
A piece of armor wrapped in magically strengthened webbing from the [[Blightreach]].

Grants the wearer a +1 to their [[Mantic]] score and the ability to, once a short rest, do double mitigation (whatever type of armor the wearer has on) to creatures while in the [[Blightreach]].

If rested with, the wearer experiences piercing headaches the next day and causing them to see things that are not there sometimes, their vision covered in cobwebs for a few seconds. (Grants disadvantage to attacks every once and a while)
