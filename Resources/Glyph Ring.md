Through down the ring and it draws out a previously stored glyph
If a scribe uses a long rest to analyze the ring, they can learn the glyph stored within, but this also uses up the charge.

Tier 1: The ring is locked into a specific glyph. When recharged with mantic energy after being used, it is always that glyph
Tier 2: The ring can be imbued with any glyph by a [[Scribe]]
