Duomancy is the variation of [[Neomancy]] found on [[Sai Yoxis II]]. Not much is known about it yet.

# Lore

Sai Yoxis II-A and Sai Yoxis II-B trade their [[Neomancy]] and [[Antimancy]] back and forth, based on their orbits. Whenever one eclipses the other of the source of Neomancy (the sun?), the one that is in front will have all the Neomancy while the one in shadow has only [[Antimancy]]. This affects the magic in strange ways. Half the time, Neomancy works as expected, maybe even a bit better than usual. But, while under the influence of Antimancy, Mantic effects are inversed. Players may have to consider this when planning an attack.

Duomancy revolves around opposites, yin and yang, give and take. Like you can give up something (health, attack power) to empower something else (attack power, armor class)? Like if you mark off 8 hit points you can add a D8 to your next roll?

Each spell will have a Neomantic and Antimantic version. Which affect is cast depends on the current orbit. Maybe there could be something like sorcery points that you can expend for meta-magic. Like cast the inversed version of a spell, amplify the effects, etc. And maybe be able to trade a spell slot for a few points and vice-versa.
