# Description

Use your quick action to mold a shield out of Mantic Energy that mitigates [[Mantic Damage]] damage. The shield is destroyed when hit for an amount that exceeds its damage threshold (2 × [[Mantic Damage]]), and it dissolves at the end of your turn if you are not focused on this spell.

You may use this as a reaction when attacked.

# Antimantic Inverse



# Radiation Fail Outcome
