# Description

As an action, tether yourself to an object or surface you can see within 50ft. Other creatures can touch and affect the tether?

If they can't see it the [[Scribe]] and [[Mage]] can work together using the [[Scry]] Glyph to keep line of sight.

The spell ends when you don't focus on it.
