[[The Wastes]]

# Fear Aura

[[Creature|Creatures]] within 15 ft of The Absent must make a DC 13 [[Fortitude]] check at the start of their turn. Failure will cause the creature to be scared of The Absent for 1 minute (disadvantage with it in sight and must move full movement **towards** The Absent). Can reroll check at the start of subsequent turns. On a success, cannot be affected by another Absent's aura for a full day.

# Multiattack

The Absent makes 2 [[#Shortsword]] attacks each turn

# Attacks

## Shortsword

+3 to hit  
5 ft range  
2d6 + 4 [[Mantic (Damage)]] damage

# Proximity Radical Fail Outcome

When a PC within 25 ft rolls a [[Radical Fail]], The Absent can teleport to their [[The Attending#Mark|marked]] creature (if no creature is marked, then they may teleport to their paired [[The Attending]]), and then can immediately make one free [[#Shortsword]] attack.

If a PC rolls a radiation failure within 25 ft of both this Absent AND its paired [[The Attending|Attending]], they instead teleport to each other and fuse, combining HP and taking the Absent's AC and other physical stats, but now no longer has to roll focus checks after hits and can use the Absent's [[Multiattack]] AND [[The Attending#Eyebeam]] each turn.
