# Description
A blackened sword forged with ancient [[Obsidian Salt]] from an ancient [[Obsidian Desert]].

+1 to hit
longsword - 1d8 +2 mantic slashing
[[Intelligence]] to hit
[[Mantic]] for damage

Wounds taken by this weapon can *only* be healed by [[Potion]]s or a **long** rest outside of the [[The Wastes|Wastes]]

This weapon also does an extra 1d8 points of damage when used within a mile of a grave with someone/something buried in it with the proper rites, when this ability is active, it whispers faintly.

If someone holding this blade desecrates a grave, the spirits held within will haunt the holder's dreams for the next few nights, warning that if they ever do it again they will leave the blade and remove the magical qualities of it. If it happens again, then that is exactly what happens.
During those haunting nights, the holder must roll hit dice and only heals that amount of HP, not all of it. And they only get half of their HP per hit dice during a short rest.
