# Attacks:
## Greatsword:
+9 to hit  
10 ft range  
2d10 + 9 slashing damage
## Headbutt:
+9 to hit
5 ft range
1d8 + 9 piercing damage
creature hit makes a DC 15 Fortitude saving throw or is pushed 15 ft back and prone, if they succeed, they can choose how far back they move (if any) and are not knocked prone.

## Runecarver:
Can use an action to draw [[Runic Circles]] on a surface or on another creature. Has 6 mantic charges per day to pump into runes. If the Dawnmarked is aware and has time, they will prepare by augmenting themselves, choosing to haste themselves, or add an extra 1d6 of damage to their attacks. They will also stalk waste travelers and lay traps for them using runes and other designed traps.

# Proximity Radical Fail Outcome
When a PC within 15 ft rolls a radiation failure, the Bound Dawnmarked can suck in the mantic energy, which allows it to regain a mantic charge and power up their gauntlet and convert it to the Light. This makes their next gauntlet attack do an extra 1d8 damage and knock the attacked creature prone (no saving throw roll).
