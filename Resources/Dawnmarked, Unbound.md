## Greatsword:
+9 to hit  
10 ft range  
2d10 + 9 slashing damage
## Headbutt:
+9 to hit
5 ft range
1d8 + 9 piercing damage
creature hit makes a DC 15 [[Fortitude]] saving throw or is pushed 15 ft back and prone, if they succeed, they can choose how far back they move (if any) and are not knocked prone.
## Runecarver:
Can use an action to draw [[Runic Circles]] on a surface or on another creature. Has 6 mantic charges per day to pump into runes. If the Dawnmarked is aware and has time, they will prepare by augmenting themselves, choosing to haste themselves, or add an extra 1d6 of damage to their attacks. They will also stalk waste travelers and lay traps for them using runes and other designed traps.

# Proximity Radical Fail Outcome
When a PC within 20 ft rolls a radiation failure, the Unbound Dawnmarked can suck in the mantic energy, which allows it to regain 2 mantic charges and gain more control over mantic energy. On their next turn, they can use an action to slow time around them. This allows them to take 1d4 turns all at once before they all resolve at the end of the last rolled turn (roll of the d4). The time bubble moves with the Unbound Dawnmarked and allows him to make attacks, carve runes, set traps, and have conversations with anyone within the bubble.


## Description:
Dawnmarked are [[The Gathering Bright]]'s most powerful "creations". Exposed to mantic energy from [[The Wastes]] and their "Light" at the same time, after years of training in a secret location, they become something not quite human. Mostly sent out into the Wastes to research, hunt, and recover artifacts, Unbound Dawnmarked are ones that lost their way in the Wastes, or were turned by something powerful. Now fully a horror, they roam the Wastes alone, killing everything in sight and gathering artifacts for themselves, or working as a powerful minion of a Lord of the Wastes.
