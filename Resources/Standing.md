The guards and soldiers that protect each village and town. Made up of volunteers led by a handful of real soldiers that have had leadership passed down to them. They work together to defend against the horrors of the [[The Wastes|Wastes]] when they attempt to attack a village or travelers arriving to one. Most of them have piece-meal armor and old weapons and are either incredibly battle-hardened, or green as grass that is no longer found on [[Sai Yoxis IV]]. Most spend most of their days doing normal jobs and only suit up when the Wastes strike back, the ones who are career standing act as "police" within villages.
