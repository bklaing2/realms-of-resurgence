[[The Wastes]]
**AC**: 14  
**HP**: 40  
**Speed**: 30 ft  
**Fortitude**: +4  
**Mantic**: +3
**Intelligence:** +3

**Passives**:  
**Battlefield Command**: Gives other Rotborne within 60 ft confidence and oversight during battle - other Rotborn thus do an extra 1d4 damage on any attack when they are within range of Overseer

**Actions**:  
**Multiattack**: (2) The Overseer makes 2 (glaive) attacks each turn.
# Attacks:
## Glaive:
+5 to hit  
10 ft range  
2d10 + 3 slashing damage

## Chain Yank:
*Refreshes on a 5-6*
Overseer can Yank the chain attached to the controlled [[Rotborne Feral]] and move it anywhere within the 25 foot chain.

# Proximity Radical Fail Outcome
When a PC within 20 ft rolls a radiation failure, the Rotborne Overseer releases the [[Rotborne Feral]] attached to its chain and flings it at the PC that radically failed. The PC must make a DC 15 Fortitude saving throw or be chained to the Overseer. Players that are chained take half the damage dealt to the Overseer and are restrained (can only move if the Overseer Yanks them). On a success, the PC takes 1d6 + 4 damage, but shrugs off the chain.


## Description
Rotborne wander [[The Wastes]] searching for things to kill, eat, and scavenge. They live in small tents made of flesh in small camps of 2-8 Overseers and their entourages. Can be traded with occasionally, but often times will attack if they feel like they have the upper hand and the opposing people have something they want (or they are hungry).
