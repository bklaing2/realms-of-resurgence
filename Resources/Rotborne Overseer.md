[[The Wastes]]

# Battlefield Command

Gives any [[Rotborne Spawn]] or [[Rotborne Feral]] within 60 ft confidence and oversight during battle - other Rotborne thus do an extra 1d4 damage on any attack when they are within range of Overseer

# Multiattack

The Overseer makes 2 (glaive) attacks each turn.

# Glaive

+5 to hit
10 ft range
2d10 + 3 [[Slashing]] damage

# Chain Yank
*Refreshes on a 5-6*

Overseer can Yank the chain attached to the controlled [[Rotborne Feral]] and move it anywhere within the 25 foot chain.

# Proximity Radical Fail Outcome

When a PC within 15 ft rolls a [[Radical Fail]], the Rotborne Overseer releases the [[Rotborne Feral]] attached to its chain and flings it at the PC that Radically Failed. The PC must make a DC 15 [[Fortitude]] check or be chained to the Overseer. Players that are chained take half the damage dealt to the Overseer and are restrained (can only move if the Overseer Yanks them). On a success, the PC takes 1d6 + 4 damage, but shrugs off the chain.


# Description

Rotborne wander [[The Wastes]] searching for things to kill, eat, and scavenge. They live in small tents made of flesh in small camps of 2-8 Overseers and their entourages. Can be traded with occasionally, but often times will attack if they feel like they have the upper hand and the opposing people have something they want (or they are hungry).
