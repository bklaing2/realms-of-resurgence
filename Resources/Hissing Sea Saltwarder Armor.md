# Description
Threaded with crystallized sea salt from the [[Hissing Sea]]

Can be [[Light Armor]], [[Medium Armor]], or [[Heavy Armor]]
Same stats of each, but base AC and mitigation are increased by 1 on each type of armor.

Once per week, the wearer of this armor can pour water from the [[Hissing Sea]] on it and regain 1d4 damage slots (even above the armor's maximum).

Slowly stiffens in humid air and smells faintly of brine and rot. As well as quietly hisses with the sound of the ocean when hit by an attack.

If thoroughly wet with water not from the [[Hissing Sea]], the wearer is incapacitated for 1 round.
