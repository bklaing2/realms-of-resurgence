# Description

As a reaction, grab the tethers of Mantic energy and pull a creature that is within 15ft of you and is about to be hit with an attack, yanking them 5ft out of the way of an attack. This yank reduces the damage they receive by the number of Mantic Charges expended.

# Antimantic Inverse

As a reaction when you are about to be hit by an attack, grab the tethers of Mantic energy and pull yourself to a creature that is within 15ft of you, yanking yourself to 5ft away from the creature. This yank reduces the damage you receive by your [[Mage]] level.

# Radiation Fail Outcome

The tethers that be yank too hard and knock the creature prone, taking full damage of the attack and putting them in a more dangerous position for future attacks.
`I feel this is too punishing, that would really suck as the guy getting pulled. I think they should just get knocked prone - B`
