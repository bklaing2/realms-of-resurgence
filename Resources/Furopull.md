# Description

As a reaction, grab the tethers of the [[Latent Radiation in Wastes]] and pull a creature that is within 15ft of you and is about to be hit with an attack, yanking them 5ft out of the way of an attack. This yank reduces the damage they receive by your furomancer level.


# Radiation Fail Outcome

The tethers that be yank too hard and knock the creature prone, taking full damage of the attack and putting them in a more dangerous position for future attacks.
`I feel this is too punishing, that would really suck as the guy getting pulled. I think they should just get knocked prone - B`
