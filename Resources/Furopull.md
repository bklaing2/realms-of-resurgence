# Description

As a quick action, grab the tethers of Mantic energy and pull a creature that is within 15ft of you 5ft towards you. They are knocked off balance until their next turn, and attacks against them have advantage.

If you use this as a reaction when the creature is about to be hit with an attack, the damage they receive is reduced by the number of [[Mantic Charge|Mantic Charges]] expended.

# Antimantic Inverse #todo

As a reaction when you are about to be hit by an attack, grab the tethers of Mantic energy and pull yourself to a creature that is within 15ft of you, yanking yourself to 5ft away from the creature. This yank reduces the damage you receive by your [[Mage]] level.

# Radiation Fail Outcome #todo

The tethers that be yank too hard and knock the creature prone, taking full damage of the attack and putting them in a more dangerous position for future attacks.
`I feel this is too punishing, that would really suck as the guy getting pulled. I think they should just get knocked prone - B`
