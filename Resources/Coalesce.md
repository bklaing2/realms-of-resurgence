# Description

As a bonus action, begin gathering furomancy around a single point near yourself. Use an action to either throw it within a range of 30ft or explode it centered on yourself. Each turn you spend your bonus action focusing on gathering furomancy increases the damage done by the spell by 1D6 up to a max of 5D6. The spell must be used on the turn it reaches max charge.
