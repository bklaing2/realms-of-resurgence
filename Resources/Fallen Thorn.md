# Description
A long dagger of ever-so-slightly glowing metal.

+2 to hit
dagger - 1d4+2 mantic slashing (light, thrown 20/60 piercing)
[[Intuition]] to hit
[[Mantic]] for damage

Once per short rest can ignore armor mitigation (or do an extra 6 points of damage to a creature without armor mitigation)

Faces can be seen reflected in the blade. Sometimes the face of someone that you *will* see within the next day.

If this comes into contact with pure, cold [[Rune-Carved Iron Spikes]], there is a 33% chance that it shatters.
