# Proximity Radical Fail Outcome
When a PC within 25 ft rolls a radiation failure, the bark and roots around Vael'ok rise up 15 ft and allow Vael'ok to "fly" for 1d6 rounds. Anywhere that Vael'ok walks, roots and bark rise up to allow Vael'ok to walk there. At the end of the rounds, they lower Vael'ok back to the ground. On Vael'ok's turn, Vael'ok can move normal movement, but now can go up and down as well.


## Description:
A tall, valiant figure in brown, bark armor. A swirling and gnarling crown of roots and vines rises from Vael'ok's helmet of bark that covers Vael'ok's face. In Vael'ok's hands you see a beautifully carved longsword made of the bark of the magical ironwood tree and a large tower shield of the same make, decorated with depictions of Barkspawn being separated and brought over to Vael'ok's enthrall. A long leaf green cloak flows out behind Vael'ok, matching the hair trickling out of the sides of the helmet.

Dangerous and territorial, Vael'ok constantly pushes his realm farther and higher with the shepherding of the trees and forests within from his place of power, "**Ginkgostalk, The Vinekeep**." Protected and held by other headless Barkspawn, now controlled by Vael'ok, this grand fortress built where a mountain and forest collide, is desolate and cold to all who enter.

Vael'ok runs their realm more like a classical "kingdom" of sorts, and even has [[Settlement]]s within their realm that, rather than threaten and destroy, Vael'ok protects them from other horrors of the [[The Wastes|Wastes]] and other [[Lords of the Wastes]], as long as the [[Settlement]]s pay their tithe and do what Vael'ok tells them to.
