# Barkstep

In a 10 ft radius around Vael'ok, roots and vines grow up and move constantly, making it difficult terrain and causing damage to anyone entering it for the first time or starting their turn there. [[Creature|Creatures]] entering or starting their turn within the range must make a DC 14 [[Fortitude]] check or take 2d8 + 8 [[Mantic (Damage)]] damage and half damage on a success.

# Multiattack

Vael'ok makes 4 attacks (3 [[#Longsword]] attacks and 1 [[#Bark Shield Bash]]) each turn.

# Attacks

# Longsword

+9 to hit
5 ft range
2d10 + 9 [[Slashing]] damage

# Bark Shield Bash

+9 to hit
5 ft range
3d6 + 5 [[Bludgeoning]] damage

# Bark Spawn
*Refreshes on a 5-6*

As an action, Vael'ok summon another Barkspawn creature to aid them in this battle, pulled from the Barkspawn that Vael'ok has killed and joined to their root system over the centuries. The summoned Barkspawn come out of the vines and roots nearby with their heads removed and a dark void able to be seen inside.

# Proximity Radical Fail Outcome

When a PC within 25 ft rolls a [[Radical Fail]], the bark and roots around Vael'ok rise up 15 ft and allow Vael'ok to "fly" for 1d6 rounds. Anywhere that Vael'ok walks, roots and bark rise up to allow Vael'ok to walk there. At the end of the rounds, they lower Vael'ok back to the ground. On Vael'ok's turn, Vael'ok can move normal movement, but now can go up and down as well.


# Description

A tall, valiant figure in brown, bark armor. A swirling and gnarling crown of roots and vines rises from Vael'ok's helmet of bark that covers Vael'ok's face. In Vael'ok's hands you see a beautifully carved longsword made of the bark of the magical ironwood tree and a large tower shield of the same make, decorated with depictions of Barkspawn being separated and brought over to Vael'ok's enthrall. A long leaf green cloak flows out behind Vael'ok, matching the hair trickling out of the sides of the helmet.

Dangerous and territorial, Vael'ok constantly pushes his realm farther and higher with the shepherding of the trees and forests within from his place of power, "**Ginkgostalk, The Vinekeep**." Protected and held by other headless Barkspawn, now controlled by Vael'ok, this grand fortress built where a mountain and forest collide, is desolate and cold to all who enter.

Vael'ok runs their realm more like a classical "kingdom" of sorts, and even has [[Settlement]]s within their realm that, rather than threaten and destroy, Vael'ok protects them from other horrors of the [[The Wastes|Wastes]] and other [[Lord of the Wastes]], as long as the [[Settlement]]s pay their tithe and do what Vael'ok tells them to.
