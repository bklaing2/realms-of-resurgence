[[The Wastes]], [[The Gathering Bright]]
**AC**: 17  
**HP**: 65  
**Speed**: 35 ft  
**[[Fortitude]]**: +8  
**[[Finesse]]:** +6
**[[Mantic]]**: +3  
**[[Intelligence]]:** +4
**[[Intuition]]:** +4
**Perception**: +4
**[[Insight]]:** +4

**Passives**:  
**Gathered Bright**: Any horror or creature of the [[The Wastes|Wastes]] within 10 ft of a Dawnmarked takes 1d10 [[Mantic]] damage at the start of their turn.

**Actions**:  
**Multiattack**: (3) Bound Dawnmarked makes 3 attacks (greatsword and gauntlet) each turn.
# Attacks:
## Greatsword:
+8 to hit  
10 ft range  
2d10 + 8 slashing damage
## Gauntlet:
+6 to hit  
5 ft range  
2d6 + 6 bludgeoning damage
## Runecarver:
Can use an action to draw [[Resources/Rune]] on a surface or on another creature. Has 3 [[Mantic]] charges per day to pump into runes. If the Dawnmarked is aware and has time, they will prepare by augmenting themselves or each other, choosing to haste each other, or add an extra 1d6 of damage to their attacks. Or uses [[Protection]] on a member of the [[The Gathering Bright|Gathering Bright]] leading clergy.

# Proximity Radical Fail Outcome
When a PC within 15 ft rolls a radiation failure, the Bound Dawnmarked can suck in the [[Mantic]] energy, which allows it to regain a [[Mantic]] charge and power up their gauntlet and convert it to the Light. This makes their next gauntlet attack do an extra 1d8 damage and knock the attacked creature prone (no saving throw roll).


## Description:
Dawnmarked are [[The Gathering Bright]]'s most powerful "creations". Exposed to [[Mantic]] energy from [[The Wastes]] and their "Light" at the same time, after years of training in a secret location, they become something not quite human. Mostly sent out into the Wastes to research, hunt, and recover artifacts, they can be found roaming the Wastes in pairs, or guarding very important clergy and their most sacred **Reliquaries**.
