**Actions**
**Multiattack** (2) the slime can make two slam attacks per turn.
# Attacks:
## Slam
+5 to hit
5 ft range
2d6 + 3 mantic damage
## Engulf:
*recharges on a 4-6*
the slime can jump forwards up to 15 ft and engulf a creature that is at least one size smaller than it
creatures within are restrained and cannot breathe and take 1d4 + 3 manic damage at the start of each of their turns. the slime can hold up to 3 creatures at one time, if a 4th were to be engulfed, roll a die to decide who gets forced out.
# Proximity Radiation Fail
when a PC rolls a radiation fail within 15 ft of a slime, it immediately gets a +10 to its HP and then divides in two (splitting its HP between the two slimes) these two slimes being smaller than the original and now only being able to hold 2 creatures at one time from engulf.
slimes can continue to split until they can no longer hold even one creature (so twice more for this example, though a larger and more dangerous slime could split more times)
