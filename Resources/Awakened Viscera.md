[[The Wastes]], [[Component]]

**Perception**: +4
**[[Subterfuge|Stealth]]**: +4

# Multiattack

The Awakened Viscera can make two [[#Slam]] attacks per turn.

# Slam

+5 to hit
5 ft range
2d6 + 3 [[Mantic (Damage)]]) damage
# Engulf

*recharges on a 4-6*
The Awakened Viscera can jump forwards up to 15 ft and engulf a [[Creature]] that is at least one size smaller than it.

Creatures within are restrained, cannot breathe, and take 1d4 + 3 [[Mantic (Damage)]] damage at the start of each of their turns. The slime can hold up to 3 creatures at one time; if a fourth creature is to be engulfed, roll 1d4 to decide who gets forced out.

# Proximity Radical Fail Outcome

When a PC rolls a [[Radical Fail]] within 15 ft of an Awakened Viscera, it immediately gets a +10 to its HP and then divides in two (splitting its HP between the two slimes) these two slimes being smaller than the original and now only being able to hold 2 creatures at one time from engulf.
slimes can continue to split until they can no longer hold even one creature (so twice more for this example, though a larger and more dangerous slime could split more times)
