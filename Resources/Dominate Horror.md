# Description

As an action, roll to control a horror you can see within 60ft. On a success, you gain control of the horror and can give it a command as a bonus action on your turn. At the end of your turn, roll to check if you keep control of the horror.

# Radiation Fail Outcome

If you get a radiation fail while attempting to dominate a horror or keep control of one, the horror targets you and immediately gets to take an extra turn.
