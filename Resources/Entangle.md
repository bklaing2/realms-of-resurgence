# Description

As an action, Mantically bind a number of creatures equal to expended [[Mantic]] Charges. An attack on one damages the other(s) for half that damage. The spell ends if you don't focus on it during your turn.

When an entangled creature is killed, you must roll a [[Constitution]] check (DC 10 + expended [[Mantic]] charges). If the check fails, the spell ends. If the check radically fails, the [[Mage]] becomes entangled as well.
