# Description
Armor patched together from ancient battlefield scavenging.

Can be [[Medium Armor]]or [[Heavy Armor]], but not [[Light Armor]]
Same stats of each, but base AC and damage slots are increased by 1 on each type of armor.

Once per short rest, the wearer can use a quick action to listen to the faint battlefield commands being whispered by the armor and yell one.
**Commands:**
- Flank - Allows an allied creature to flank with you, giving you and them advantage on attacks until the end of your next turn. The allied creature must already be in a flanking position, or move into one on their next turn to get this benefit.
- Push Forward - 
- Fall Back - 
- 

Slowly stiffens in humid air and smells faintly of brine and rot. As well as quietly hisses with the sound of the ocean when hit by an attack.

If thoroughly wet with water not from the [[Hissing Sea]], the wearer is incapacitated for 1 round.
