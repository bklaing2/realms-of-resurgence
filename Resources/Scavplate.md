# Description
Armor patched together from ancient battlefield scavenging.

Can be [[Medium Armor]]or [[Heavy Armor]], but not [[Light Armor]]
Same stats of each, but base AC and damage slots are increased by 1 on each type of armor.

Once per short rest, the wearer can use a quick action to listen to the faint battlefield commands being whispered by the armor and yell one.
**Commands:**
- **Flank** - Allows an allied creature to flank with you, giving you and them advantage on attacks until the end of your next turn. The allied creature must already be in a flanking position, or move into one on their next turn to get this benefit.
- **Push Forward** - You and two allies within 30 ft of you immediately move 15 ft towards an enemy.
- **Fall Back** - You and two allies within 30 ft of you immediately move 20 ft away from an enemy.
- **Bait and Switch** - When you're within 5 feet of a creature on your turn, you can use a command and switch places with that creature, provided you spend at least 5 feet of movement and the creature is willing and isn't incapacitated. Until the start of your next turn, you or the other creature (your choice) gains a bonus to AC equal to your level.

Grows cold near gravesites and faint battlefield commands whisper into the wind from a command long dead.

#todo **Still needs a curse or detriment**
