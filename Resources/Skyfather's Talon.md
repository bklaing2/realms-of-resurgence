# Description
A hooked war-sickle with a bone handle carved in avian shapes.

+1 to hit
1d6+2 mantic slashing damage
5 ft range
[[Intuition]] to hit
[[Mantic]] damage


Strikes against creatures with fewer than 8 HP (if they started with more than that) gain an extra +2 to hit and to damage. The wielder feels pulled towards those close to death. Occasionally twitches toward exposed throats, even those of friends. [[Fortitude]] check, DC 8 + the HP of the creature with the exposed throat or you make a strike on them, against your control.

Carrion birds gather nearby when blood is spilled by this weapon.
