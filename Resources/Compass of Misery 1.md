# Description
Small compass made of rusting metal.

Needle points toward the nearest grave site with more than 10 bodies buried. (likely a [[Settlement]] or some other point of interest in the Wastes)

Spins wildly when in [[The Wastes]], with a DC 12+waste level [[Tinker]] check to find the correct direction. If failed, you go off towards the last thing that was killed.
Rusts quickly despite care.
