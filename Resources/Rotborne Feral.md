[[The Wastes]]

# Rot Stench

[[Creature|Creatures]] within 10 ft of a Rotborne Feral must make a [[Fortitude]] saving throw DC 12 at the top of each turn or be poisoned for 1 minute (poison condition means creatures take 1d4 damage at the top of each of their turns). Once a creature succeeds a saving throw, they are immune to that particular Feral's stench for a day, but will still roll a saving throw if they are near other Feral's.

# Battlefield Soldier

If within 60 ft of a Rotborne Overseer, deals an extra 1d4 damage on every attack.

# Multiattack

The Feral makes 3 (2 [[#Claw]] and 1 [[#Bite]]) attacks each turn. *(4 attacks, two of each, if off their chain)*

# Claw

+6 to hit
5 ft range
2d4 + 2 [[Slashing]] damage

# Bite

+6 to hit
5 ft range
1d8 + 2 [[Piercing]] damage

# Proximity Radical Fail Outcome

When a PC within 20 ft rolls a [[Radical Fail]], the Rotborne Feral goes absolutely nuts and breaks off of their chain to attack the PC furthest from their original Overseer. When off the chain (whether by this or by the [[Rotborne Overseer]] dropping the chain) the Feral takes an extra [[#Bite]] attack each turn and targets the player **furthest** from their original chain holder.

# Description

Rotborne wander [[The Wastes]] searching for things to kill, eat, and scavenge. They live in small tents made of flesh in small camps of 2-8 Overseers and their entourages. Can be traded with occasionally, but often times will attack if they feel like they have the upper hand and the opposing people have something they want (or they are hungry).
