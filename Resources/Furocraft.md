# Description

As a bonus action, mold furomancy into a solid form of one of: shield, dagger, short sword, longsword, or javelin. The object stays as long as you spend your bonus action focusing on it. If it leaves your hand for more than one turn or you don't focus on it the object evaporates back into latent furomancy.

You may also use a reaction to craft it into a shield.
