# Description

As a quick action, mold Mantic energy into a solid shield or weapon of your choice. The object will be empowered with [[Mantic Damage]].

The object persists only while you maintain focus and remains in your possession. If it leaves your hand for more than one turn or you fail to focus on the spell during your turn, it dissolves into latent Mantic energy.

You can additionally use your quick action to change the object into a different form.
You may cast this spell as a reaction when you are attacked.
