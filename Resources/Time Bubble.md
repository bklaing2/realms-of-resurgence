# Description

As an action, push all Mantic energy away from you in a 10ft sphere. The flow of time is greatly increased inside the bubble and any creature within immediately gains 1D4+2 extra turns. Any projectile exiting the bubble stops at the edge, keeping its momentum. After all turns have been taken, resolve everything outside the bubble. Additionally, any rolls within the bubble do not require the radiation die, as the latent radiation has been pushed back.

Just a #brainstorm, but I'm not a fan of this - B
hmm yea, we can think of something better - J
The radiation is instead pulled towards you in a 5ft sphere. Any creature within its radius loses one turn.
