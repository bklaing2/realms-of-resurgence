[[The Wastes]], [[Component]]
  
# Forest rest

When not moving, blends in with the trees and landscape around them to look just like very tall trees. **Advantage** on [[Subterfuge|stealth]] and very hard to see when not looking.

# Slam

+8 to hit
10 ft range
1d12 + 5 [[Bludgeoning]] damage
# Kick

20 ft line - 5 ft wide - 10 ft in front and 10 ft behind the sleeper
3d10 + 5 bludgeoning damage
PCs make a DC 14 [[Finesse]] saving throw or catch a face of bark leg. 1/2 damage on a success.
# Proximity Radical Fail Outcome

When a PC within 30 ft rolls a [[Radical Fail]], the Barkspawn Sleeper suddenly blooms and PCs within 15 ft must make DC 12 [[Finesse]] saving throws to avoid rotten fruit and large seeds that fall from the top of the Sleeper. Failures take 6d6 + 6 damage and 1/2 on a success.
