***Great Horror***

[[The Wastes|Wastes]], [[Component]]

# Iron Bark

Resistant to [[Slashing]], [[Bludgeoning]], and [[Piercing]] damage from non-[[Mantic]] attacks.

# Multiattack

Tyrant makes 3 (1 [[#Bite]] and 2 [[#Bark Spike]]) attacks each turn.

# Bite

+10 to hit
10 ft range
2d12 + 10 [[Bludgeoning]] damage and the PC is swallowed.

*While swallowed, creature takes 2d6 + 7 [[Bludgeoning]] damage at the start of each of their turns. Creature is spit out if the Tyrant takes 20 damage in one round or 15 damage from within. Swallowed creatures are restrained.*

# Bark Spike

+10 to hit
40 ft range
3d8 + 7 piercing damage
PCs make a DC 16 [[Finesse]] check or become [[Pinned]] and [[Restrained]]  by the spike.

# Proximity Radical Fail Outcome

When a PC within 40 ft rolls a radiation failure, the Barkspawn Tyrant becomes enraged and now has 2 separate turns in the initiative order every round, moving with [[Mantic]] speed and power.
