The people that allow the villages and towns to stay connected. They travel between the villages and deliver letters and other items sent by the citizens of [[Sai Yoxis IV]]. They have spent years drawing maps and creating paths through the [[The Wastes|Wastes]]. Rather that fighting any of the Wastes' denizens they may come across, the couriers run and move fast and use distractions to escape them. They hold a strong creed and duty to what they do. They don't search for anything in the Wastes other than a way to survive and arrive at their destination
