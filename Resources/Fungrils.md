Fungrils resemble a mushroom in humanoid form. Because of this, their appearance can vary wildly: they may be anywhere from about 2 feet to 7 feet tall, and either more humanoid or more fungal in appearance. They come in an assortment of colors, from earth tones to bright reds, yellows, purples, and blues. Their physical forms are non-standardized, resulting in an incredible variety of bodies, faces, and limbs. While the common lifespan of a fungril is about 300 years, some are reported to live much longer. Though they can vocalize or communicate nonverbally, many members of this ancestry use a mycelial array to chemically exchange information with other fungrils across long distances.
