# Attacks:
## Bow-rapier

10 ft range
3d8 + 7 piercing damage
## Bow-bow
+7 to hit
60/120 ft range
2d10 + 7 piercing damage

## Play the Song
Creatures in a 50 ft radius of a Fiddler must make an [[Intuition]] saving throw, DC 15, or become charmed by the fiddler. Creatures that are charmed cannot attack the fiddler directly, and other creatures have advantage on the first attack against them. Once the creature has been attacked, they are no longer charmed until they fail another saving throw.
# Proximity Radiation Fail
When a PC rolls a radiation fail within 15 ft of the fiddler, the tune changes on the fiddle and everyone who is currently charmed is instantly stunned until the end of the fiddler's next turn. Stunned creatures cannot move and melee attacks are auto critical hits on them.
