[[Unstable Mixture Concocting]]

# Other

Potions take a certain amount of time to make.
Can work with hunters to make special arrows, but that requires both of them so neither can do their own thing during that time
Alchemist's potions go inert after some time, unless they were made at a full alchemists station.
