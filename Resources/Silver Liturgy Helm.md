# Description
Heavy helm engraved with fragments of prayers to long forgotten gods.

+2 to [[Intuition]] while worn.

Removing it causes the wearer to be disoriented and confused for the next day, having disadvantage on any mental checks ([[Intuition]] and [[Intelligence]])

Distant chanting can be heard while in silence while wearing this helm.
