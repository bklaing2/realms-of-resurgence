Variation of [[Druid]] found on [[Sai Yoxis I]]

# Abilities

## Passive: Mutant Speak #needs/name

Speak with known creatures within 120ft
At level 5 the range increases 200ft

## Mutate

Once per short rest, spend an action to mutate into a level 1-2 non-swimming non-flying low-sentience horror. When mutated, you gain the horror's abilities and HP. When your hitpoints are reduced to 0, you revert to your normal form and number of hitpoints you started with before you mutated. Any excess damage carries over to your normal form.
You can stay in your mutated state for a number of hours equal to your level. You then revert to your normal form. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn.
Your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your form.
You retain benefits of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you can't use any of your special senses, such as darkvision, unless your new form also has that sense.
Your equipment falls to the ground when you mutate and will need to be picked up by a fellow party member.

## Mutate II #needs/name

Mutation can be performed twice per short rest, and gain access to level 1-4 non-flying low-sentience horror. You also no longer have to roll the radiation die when mutated.

## Ability 3 #needs/name #todo

## Mutate III #needs/name

You can now mutate into level 1-7 low-sentience horror.
