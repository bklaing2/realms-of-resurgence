[[The Wastes]], [[The Gathering Bright]]

# Gathered Bright

Any [[Horror]] or [[Creature]] of the [[The Wastes|Wastes]] within 10 ft of a Dawnmarked takes 1d10 [[Mantic]] damage at the start of their turn.

# Multiattack

Bound Dawnmarked makes 3 attacks ([[#Greatsword]] and [[#Gauntlet]]) each turn.

# Greatsword

+8 to hit
10 ft range
2d10 + 8 [[Slashing]] damage

# Gauntlet

+6 to hit
5 ft range
2d6 + 6 [[Bludgeoning]] damage

# Runecarver

Can use an action to draw [[Rune|Runes]] on a surface or on another creature. Has 3 [[Mantic Charge|Mantic Charges]] per day to pump into runes. If the Dawnmarked is aware and has time, they will prepare by augmenting themselves or each other, choosing to haste each other, or add an extra 1d6 of damage to their attacks. Or uses [[Protection]] on a member of the [[The Gathering Bright|Gathering Bright]] leading clergy.

# Proximity Radical Fail Outcome

When a PC within 15 ft rolls a [[Radical Fail]], the Bound Dawnmarked can suck in the [[Mantic]] energy, which allows it to regain a [[Mantic Charge]] and power up their [[#Gauntlet]] and convert it to the Light. This adds 1d8 damage to their next [[#Gauntlet]] attack and knocks the attacked creature prone (no saving throw roll).


# Description

Dawnmarked are [[The Gathering Bright]]'s most powerful "creations". Exposed to [[Mantic]] energy from [[The Wastes]] and their "Light" at the same time, after years of training in a secret location, they become something not quite human. Mostly sent out into the Wastes to research, hunt, and recover artifacts, they can be found roaming the Wastes in pairs, or guarding very important clergy and their most sacred **Reliquaries**.
