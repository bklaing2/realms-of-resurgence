# Description

As an action, target a creature within 30ft. A beam of Mantic energy arcs from you to the target. Any target of this beam takes [[Mantic Damage]] damage, and has disadvantage on saving throws and checks for 1 round as the Mantic energy diffuses through its body.

If you are focusing on this spell at the end of your next round, the beam jumps to another creature within 15ft of the host that it hasn't hit. This repeats every round until either you stop focusing on this spell or the beam has hit every creature within range of the current host.

# Antimantic Inverse



# Radiation Fail Outcome

It targets to the closest creature to you, or you if there's no one else within 30ft.
