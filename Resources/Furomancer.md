## Casting Spells Within [[The Wastes]]

When casting spells while in the Wastes the [[The Wastes#Furomantical Radiation|Furomantical Radiation]] acts as a spellcasting focus, allowing spells to be cast without their required components. However, make a Radiation Roll whenever casting a spell.

On a [[The Wastes#D20 = Radiation Die (Success due to Radiation)|Radical Success]], gain back an expended spell slot.

If a [[The Wastes#D20 < Radiation Die (Fail due to Radiation)|Radical Failure]] causes the spell to fail, the outcome will go haywire according to the spell's description.
