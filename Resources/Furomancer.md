# Spellcasting
Furomancers are able to bend furomancy to their will with greater control then most. The Spellcasting Table shows how many [[#Cantrips]], [[#Spells]], and spell slots are available to you.

## Cantrips
In order to cast a cantrip you must expend any components the cantrip requires. When leveling up you may exchange one cantrip for any other.

## Spells
You must know a spell in order to cast it. In order to cast a spell you must expend a spell slot and any components the spell requires. When leveling up you may exchange one spell for any other of the same tier.

Some spells require focus to maintain. This means that if you do not spend your bonus action on your turn focusing on the spell, the spell will stop.

### Casting Spells While in [[The Wastes]]
When casting spells while in the Wastes the [[Latent Radiation in Wastes]] acts as a spellcasting focus, allowing spells to be cast without their required components.

On a [[Radiation Critical Success]], gain back an expended spell slot.

If a [[Radiation Fail]] causes the spell to fail, the outcome will go haywire according to the spell's description.
