Found on [[Sai Yoxis IV]]

At some point during their lives, caterpillarfolk may choose to metamorphose into a [[Butterflyfolk]], normally before, after, or during an important moment or decision in their life. When this occurs, the player loses all caterpillarfolk abilities and takes on the same chosen abilities of the [[Butterflyfolk]] (so if you chose the [[Silk Production]] ability as a caterpillarfolk, you now have the [[Fast Flying]] ability).
The metamorphosis occurs over the course of one turn (action to enter it during your turn, and your next turn you will exit the chrysalises as a [[Butterflyfolk]]) or you can have it occur over the course of a rest - up to you, your GM, and what you feel is right. But you do not have to become a [[Butterflyfolk]] if you do not want to.
