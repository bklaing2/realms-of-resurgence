[[The Wastes]]
**AC**: 12  
**HP**: 15 
**Speed**: 40 ft  (fly)
**[[Finesse]]**: +3  
**Mantic**: +4  
**Perception**: +4

**Passives**:  
**Stealthy**: Advantage on stealth checks and perception checks.

**Actions**:
# Attacks:

## Eyebeam:
+4 to hit  
40 ft range  
1d8 + 4 mantic damage

**Mark:**
As an action, The Attending can Mark a creature. This creature now becomes the chosen target of its paired [[Absent, The]] and gives them Advantage on that target when they are within sight of The Attending. The Attending must use its Quick Action on subsequent turns to focus on Mark and must make Mantic saving throws each time it is hit with a DC of the damage taken to maintain focus.

# Proximity Radical Fail Outcome
When a PC within 25 ft rolls a radiation failure, The Attending can swap places with their paired [[Absent, The]] via teleportation, and then can immediately make a free Eyebeam or Mark.

If a PC rolls a radiation failure within 25 ft of both this The Attending AND its paired [[Absent, The]], they instead teleport to each other and fuse, combining HP and taking The Absent's AC and other physical stats, but now no longer has to roll focus checks after hits and can use the Absent's multiattack AND the Attending's eyebeam each turn.
