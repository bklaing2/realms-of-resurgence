[[The Wastes]]

# Spider Climb

Climbing speed is doubled, can climb on walls

# Weapon Attack

+5 to hit
10 ft range
Weapon dice for the weapon being used x2 +4

# Proximity Radical Fail Outcome

Mantic energy is redirected into a nearby (within 60 ft) Fleshwrought Armor that has been slain. The body parts begin to reanimate and attack nearby PCs with reduced stats. If more [[Radical Fail]]s are rolled, more slain body parts reanimate.
