# Brainstorm

This planet has very dangerous and unpredictable magic (which they call Furomancy and the people who do it Furomancers) it rarely does what they want it to do and it tends to overpower even the simplest of spells and reverse back on the user.


Everyone's gonna be first of all half casters and then also like I'm gonna be very specific like the magic spells and how many spells everyone has like, I don't think it's gonna be like oh yeah, like it even if you have like a Paladin technically a half cast or a Ranger they still have like a fair crap ton of spell slots and I'll listen to spell slots and I'm thinking the campaign was shorter cause the campaign won't go till 20 cause level 20 People in a grim dark fantasy horror realm wouldn't make any sense so I think I would only go up to like 10 as the max and those people would be like but that would definitely take some more work. I'm gonna I'm gonna do some work on it it's not just gonna be strictly DND. There's gonna be some differences in health points and differences and. But even like a level 10 range still gonna have like For sheriff spell spot since I don't want to I'll probably mess with that, but I would love for OK yeah I'm a paladin I have you know four spell slots. I'm a handful of spells and first of all there's gonna be some there's already gonna be some sort of like, especially in the cities. This is why I wanted to take this out this record this out so I can kind of think like this and you can hear it all and laugh at me dummy, but in the city like all magic is gonna have chances to not function because partly because of the magic that build it like hold the cities together and make sure that the darkness of the wastes stuff and get in that messes with the magic of the world as well and so magic in the cities won't be a sure thing you'll have to roll for that almost like on the wild magic table, but not exactly In the wastes, the magic will be a little bit more of a sure thing just because you're in the way you're in the waist. There's more like magic around you. You can tap into a little bit more but then I want it to be like OK if you have four levels of whatever it's called, you know whatever this is darkness is weight of darkness or whatever.
