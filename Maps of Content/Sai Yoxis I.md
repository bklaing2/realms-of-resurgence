Sai Yoxis I is the first planet in the [[Sai Yoxis System]]. It is imbued with pure [[Neomancy]].

# Thoughts

I'm picturing this planet to be most similar to a normal D&D setting, though low magic. I think the people of this planet are more hoity-toity than the people of the other planets. They take pride in their architecture and their fashion. Sweeping cities that look like Asgard in the marvel movies. The magic here is ubiquitous, but not very powerful. No extra game mechanics, just your run of the mill TTRPG system. This will probably be the hardest sub-class to make appealing.
