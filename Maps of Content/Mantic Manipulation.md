Every creature throughout the planets of [[Sai Yoxis System|Sai Yoxis]] are imbued with [[Neomancy]], some more than others. This manifests itself in various ways, from simply making a creature more hardy, to giving them fantastical power.
Some have learned how to manipulate Neomancy and bend it to their will with greater control than others. There are two main methods to do this: by [[Runic Circles|inscribing Runes]] or [[#Neomantic Spells|casting Spells]].

#brainstorm Overclocking: a being has a [[Mantic Charge]] capacity equal to their mantic score. If a creature finishes their turn with more [[Mantic Charge|mantic charges]] than their mantic score (e.g. a fighter powers up a mage), the excess charges explode within them and they take a d6 of damage for each excess charge.

#brainstorm A spell/rune for every combination of attributes. You add your scores to them. Maybe you can't cast a spell unless you have a positive value for each required attribute. OR can only cast a spell according to this calculation: Summation of a creatures relevant attributes must match the order of the spell.
