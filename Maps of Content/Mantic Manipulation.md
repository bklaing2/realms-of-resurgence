Every creature throughout the planets of [[Sai Yoxis System|Sai Yoxis]] are imbued with [[Neomancy]], some more than others. This manifests itself in various ways, from simply making a creature more hardy, to giving them fantastical power.
Some have learned how to manipulate Neomancy and bend it to their will with greater control than others. There are two main methods to do this: by [[Runic Circles|inscribing Runes]] or [[#Neomantic Spells|casting Spells]].
