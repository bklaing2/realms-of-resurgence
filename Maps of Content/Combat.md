# Weapons

## Calculating to Hit

## Calculating Damage Given on a Hit

Weapon damage + Related weapon attribute (finesse or fortitude)



# Armor

There are three basic types of [[Maps of Content/Armor|armor]],

## Equipping Armor

| Type   | Required Attributes         | Base AC | Mitigation | Damage Threshold (2\*mitigation) | Damage Slots |
| ------ | --------------------------- | ------- | ---------- | -------------------------------- | ------------ |
| Light  | +2 Finesse                  | 8       | 4          | 8                                | 2            |
| Medium | +1 Finesse and +1 Fortitude | 6       | 6          | 12                               | 4            |
| Heavy  | +2 Fortitude                | 4       | 8          | 16                               | 6            |
#brainstorm What if you rolled a die for mitigating damage on each hit? Higher tiers you roll multiple die. Then the Mitigation becomes a Mitigation die

## Calculating AC

Finesse + Intuition + Base AC of Armor

## Calculating Damage Received on a Hit

Subtract the armor mitigation from the damage. If it falls below zero you take no damage. If it falls above the armor's damage threshold, you take damage like normal and mark off an armor damage slot. 
#brainstorm  can also make it on a critical hit against you mark off a damage slot

## Armor Damage Slots

Armor has a certain number of extreme hits it can withstand. If it takes all of these, it breaks. A damage slot can be repaired on a short rest with the help of an armor repair kit. A damage slot can be repaired during a long rest without the aid of an armor repair kit. if it breaks completely, it must be taken to an armorer to be repaired.

## Armor Breaks

When you mark the last armor damage slot, the armor stops mitigating damage, but you keep the AC

# Upgrading

If you have the right materials and enough money, you can upgrade your armor or weapon at a blacksmith or armorer or weaponsmith. E.g. +1 to an armor's mitigation


# Initiative

Roll a d20 and add your finesse modifier. If in [[The Wastes]], roll the Radiation Die. On a [[The Wastes#D20 < Radiation Die (Radical Failure)]], you automatically go at the end of initiative. On a [[The Wastes#D20 = Radiation Die (Radical Success)]], you can choose where you go in initiative order after it has been set for everyone else.

## Rolling as a Group

Players can choose to roll initiative as a group. Each player rolls as normal, and the group is inserted into initiative based on the lowest roll.

## Initiative Blocks

Allies that are grouped in the initiative order don't need to strictly follow the initiative order. A player at the end of the group can choose to do their action at the beginning, an a player at the start can wait to move until their ally has attacked, or a player can even take their whole turn at a different time within that block.

## Waiting

During combat, you have the option to wait, changing your place in initiative order. This sacrifices your turn in the current round, but you are placed anywhere in initiative that you choose starting the next round.
