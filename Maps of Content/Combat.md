# Weapons #in-progress

## Calculating to Hit

Roll a d20 and add the related attribute for the [[Weapons|weapon]] (likely the [[Finesse]] or [[Fortitude]])

## Calculating Damage Given on a Hit

Weapon damage + Related weapon attribute ([[Finesse]] or [[Fortitude]])

#brainstorm The to hit and damage numbers will each have an associated attribute. To hit will have a mental attribute, and damage will have a physical attribute. For example, a bow may use [[Intelligence]] for the to hit number (cause aiming is hard) and damage will use [[Fortitude]] (how strong you are to pull it back farther). Additionally, if you're using a weapon in your offhand, don't include the to hit attribute score when calculating to hit

#brainstorm Should opp attacks just be if you started the turn in their range?



# Armor

There are three basic types of [[Maps of Content/Armor|armor]],

## Equipping Armor

| Type   | Required Attributes                 | Base AC | Mitigation | Damage Threshold (2\*mitigation) | Damage Slots |
| ------ | ----------------------------------- | ------- | ---------- | -------------------------------- | ------------ |
| Light  | +2 [[Finesse]]                      | 8       | 4          | 8                                | 6            |
| Medium | +1 [[Finesse]] and +1 [[Fortitude]] | 6       | 6          | 12                               | 4            |
| Heavy  | +2 [[Fortitude]]                    | 4       | 8          | 16                               | 2            |
#brainstorm What if you rolled a die for mitigating damage on each hit? Higher tiers you roll multiple die. Then the Mitigation becomes a Mitigation die

#brainstorm if you do not have the required attributes to wear the armor, you can still wear it and gain the AC benefit, but not be able to mitigate any damage. You still mark damage slots based on thresholds in case you become able to mitigate, it still may be broken.

## Calculating AC

[[Finesse]] + [[Intuition]] + Base AC of Armor

## Calculating Damage Received on a Hit

Subtract the armor mitigation from the damage. If it falls below zero you take no damage. If it falls above the armor's damage threshold, you take damage like normal and mark off an armor damage slot. 
#brainstorm  can also make it on a critical hit against you mark off a damage slot

#brainstorm order of events: mitigation > other reduction (e.g. [[Brawler]] mania)

### On a Critical Hit

Roll and add max potential dice damage to it

## Armor Damage Slots

Armor has a certain number of extreme hits it can withstand. If it takes all of these, it breaks. A damage slot can be repaired on a short rest with the help of an armor repair kit. A damage slot can be repaired during a long rest without the aid of an armor repair kit. if it breaks completely, it must be taken to an armorer to be repaired.

## Armor Breaks

When you mark the last armor damage slot, the armor stops mitigating damage, but you keep the AC

# Upgrading

If you have the right materials and enough money, you can upgrade your armor or weapon at a blacksmith or armorer or weaponsmith. E.g. +1 to an armor's mitigation


# Initiative

Roll a d20 and add your [[Finesse]] modifier. If in [[The Wastes]], roll the Radiation Die. On a [[The Wastes#D20 < Radiation Die (Radical Failure)]], you automatically go at the end of initiative. On a [[The Wastes#D20 = Radiation Die (Radical Success)]], you can choose where you go in initiative order after it has been set for everyone else.

## Rolling as a Group

Players can choose to roll initiative as a group. Each player rolls as normal, and the group is inserted into initiative based on the lowest roll.

## Initiative Blocks

Allies that are grouped in the initiative order don't need to strictly follow the initiative order. A player at the end of the group can choose to do their action at the beginning, an a player at the start can wait to move until their ally has attacked, or a player can even take their whole turn at a different time within that block.

## Waiting

During combat, you have the option to wait, changing your place in initiative order. This sacrifices your turn in the current round, but you are placed anywhere in initiative that you choose starting the next round.
