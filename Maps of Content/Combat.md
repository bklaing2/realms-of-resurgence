# Initiative

Roll a d20 and add your finesse modifier. If in [[The Wastes]], roll the Radiation Die. On a [[The Wastes#D20 < Radiation Die (Radical Failure)]], you automatically go at the end of initiative. On a [[The Wastes#D20 = Radiation Die (Radical Success)]], you can choose where you go in initiative order after it has been set for everyone else.

## Rolling as a Group

Players can choose to roll initiative as a group. Each player rolls as normal, and the group is inserted into initiative based on the lowest roll.

## Initiative Blocks

Allies that are grouped in the initiative order don't need to strictly follow the initiative order. A player at the end of the group can choose to do their action at the beginning, an a player at the start can wait to move until their ally has attacked, or a player can even take their whole turn at a different time within that block.

## Waiting

During combat, you have the option to wait, changing your place in initiative order. This sacrifices your turn in the current round, but you are placed anywhere in initiative that you choose starting the next round.
