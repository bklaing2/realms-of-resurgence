Sai Yoxis IV is the fourth planet in the [[Sai Yoxis System]]. It is home to a variation of [[Neomancy]] called [[Furomancy]]. Furomancy is the most powerful, and most dangerous, form of Neomancy. Furomancy was created from an experiment gone wrong on Neomancy. They hypothesized they could make Neomancy more powerful, and therefore useful, by infusing it with [[Antimancy]]. But their calculations were incorrect. When they tried to infuse Neomancy with Antimancy, the Neomancy rejected it. Antimancy spread like lightning through the Neomancy, warping them both into Furomancy. It is immensely unstable, and Furomancy is especially volatile within [[The Wastes]].

# Thoughts

I'm picturing this planet to be like steampunk-ish in the time leading up to [[The Cataclysm]]
