| :------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | --- |
| **[[Fortitude]]**                      | *Strength, toughness*                       |     |
| **[[Finesse]]**                        | *Sneaking, lockpicking*                     |     |

## Roll for Base Attribute Value

Take 2d4, assign one to be positive and the to be negative. Roll and add these 6 times, then drop the lowest. Assign the remaining values to attributes of your choice.

#brainstorm could use a d6 (positive) and d4 (negative) instead

## Add Bonuses from your Race/Background

Some races/backgrounds give bonus to Physical or Mental attributes. These can be distributed between the attributes in the specified category, up to a maximum of 3 for any attribute.

## Calculate Second Order Attributes #brainstorm #needs/name

Each [[Second Order Attributes]] is associated with two [[First Order Attributes]]^[![[Attribute#Second Order Attributes Matrix]]]. Its modifier can be calculated by taking the higher of the two [[First Order Attributes]]. 

# Health

At level 0 everyone starts with 6hp

# Levelling Up

You must rest to level up

## Ability Score Increase

Add one to any ability score.

## Health

Roll a hit die (determined by your class) and add your new level (so levelling up to level 1 will be a roll + 1, levelling to 5 will give roll + 5) to your hp when you level up. Some classes and races get bonuses to this.

## General Level Unlocks

Every adventurer starts at level 0 - essentially a normal person. The first class ability isn't unlocked until level 1. As the adventure progresses, each character follows the same general outline when levelling up as described in the table below.
