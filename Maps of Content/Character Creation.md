## Roll for Base Attribute Value

Take 2d4, assign one to be positive and the to be negative. Roll and add these 6 times, then drop the lowest. Assign the remaining values to attributes of your choice.

## Add Bonuses from your Race/Background

Some races/backgrounds give bonus to Physical or Mental attributes. These can be distributed between the attributes in the specified category, up to a maximum of 3 for any attribute.

# Health

At level 0 everyone starts with 6hp

When leveling up, add a hp die (determined by your class) to your hp when you level up. Some classes and races get bonuses to this

# General Level Unlocks

Every adventurer starts at level 0 - essentially a normal person. The first class ability isn't unlocked until level 1. As the adventure progresses, each character follows the same general outline when levelling up as described in the table below.
