Each item will have three attributes: Price, Weight, and Size.

Things like backpacks will only have a certain amount of space, meaning they can only hold a collection of items whose total Size is <= to that space capacity.

A player can only carry a backpack (+ the armor they're wearing yada yada) according to their Fortidude attribute.
