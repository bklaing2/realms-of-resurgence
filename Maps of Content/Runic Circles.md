Long ago, [[Scribe|Scribes]] discovered a way to influence Neomancy. By inscribing very precise patterns onto a surface and directing Mantic energy into it, various magical effects can be produced depending on the design of the runes and components used.

> Each effect (healing, protection) has it's own rune/symbol/design. Etching the rune produces a better/stronger effect than if it was simply drawn on a surface. Some more powerful effects may not work unless the rune is etched (as opposed to drawn).

> The material used to draw or etch a rune produces different effects. If you draw a rune using charcoal vs sprinkling salt. If you etch it onto wood vs in stone

> Runes will have a base glyph that produces one desired effect (E.g. [[Augment]] or [[Protection]]). The components used on it after it is drawn decide what it effects (HP, AC, etc). What the rune is drawn on determines how the effect manifests

# Inscription

You must know a rune in order to inscribe it. In order to inscribe a rune you must expend any components the rune requires. Runes can be inscribed on any surface on which the design can be carved.

Tier 1 runes take 1 action to 1 minute to inscribe
Tier 2 runes take 10 minutes or less to inscribe
Tier 3 runes take greater than 10 minutes to inscribe

# Activation

Simply inscribing a rune does not produce its effect. You must then funnel Mantic energy into the rune to activate it. You can have a number of active runes equal to half your Scribe level rounded down, minimum of one.

### Third Party Activation

Additionally, runes can be activated by other sources of Neomancy. For example, a [[Mage]] can expend a spell slot to activate a rune, or a [[Fighter]] can hit it with a [[Fighter#Mantic Charges|Mantic Charge]]
