these will stalk just anywhere and are basically searching for food. they sense the "anti-spark" inside the people of the world and hunt it down to eat it to survive or gain something or because of something pushing them to.

takes a whole turn (or whatever) to change into their hunting form

## Low-Sentience High-Power #needs/name 

> [!INFO]- About
> the normal everyday monsters that live in [[The Wastes]], but these are truly powerful horrors. these have the power to level a large village or maybe small town if there are more than one.

> 
> will break these down into different types of horrors. but these are like similar to what an ogre or hill giant would be in dnd - sometimes maybe controlled by a high sentience - low power creature, but can be rare. very animalistic in nature. they don't plan or have civilizations or anything. they live to eat and reproduce and kill

> - a group of well equipped and planned soldiers/travelers could kill one of these some of the time

## High-Sentience High-Power #needs/name 

> [!INFO]- About
> the ruling monsters that live deep in [[The Wastes]]. these have the power to level/control a large city or maybe lay siege to a country if they felt like it. many of these have their own motivations and tend to control areas of [[The Wastes]] and may even do battle against other [[#High-Sentience High-Power needs/name]] of other areas to gain more territory.
> 
> these will have their own lair in which they live and have lesser horrors working for them and doing their bidding. they sense the "anti-spark" inside the people of the world and sometimes hunt it down to eat it if the draw is so big (someone very powerful in [[The Wastes]] or a large group of people).
> 
> will break these down into different types of horrors. but think of these as adult dragons in neighboring territories - not demi-god status, but not anything that anyone wants to ever have to deal with. - sometimes maybe in a mutualistic relationship with another [[#High-Sentience High-Power needs/name]] or [[#Rulers of The Wastes needs/name]]. these things plan and have plans within plans and small civilizations unto their own of other smaller horrors that they allow to live and hunt in their territories.
> 
> - anyone average could not even consider surviving the sight of one of these, let alone a fight.
> - an army of well equipped and planned soldiers could maybe kill one of these some of the time
> - veteran travelers will not enter into the territories of the more powerful of these horrors, especially depending on how long their group has been out in [[The Wastes]] (the longer out there, the more enticing they are).
> - some legendary travelers have stories told about how they have negotiated with one of these horrors or tricked them or played one against the other, but these stories have been mostly lost to time.


## Rulers of The Wastes #needs/name 

> [!INFO]- About
> People that - for whatever reason - did not mutate like all the rest. they woke up after [[The Cataclysm]] in the middle of the wreckage and just had incredible powers bestowed into them by the blast of [[Furomancy]].
> because they are also "of the blast" the horrors see them as one of them. not attacking them at all (because the low power horrors can also sense how much power they have).
> 
> They became functionally immortal and just full of the latent energy that fills the world now. it pushed them to live and conquer [[The Wastes]] for themselves. many of them form symbiotic relationships with [[#Low-Sentience High-Power needs/name]] and sometimes even [[#High-Sentience High-Power needs/name]] to form very dangerous pairings to rule their corners of [[The Wastes]].
> 
> Many of them have motivations, some may even control "human" cities without anyone knowing...
