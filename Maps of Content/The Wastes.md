# Furomantical Radiation

The immense amount Furomantical radiation seeps into the bodies of those traveling within the Wastes. This latent energy is very difficult to control and does more to dampen and hamper a person and their "spark" than it does it "fill them with magic". However, after a certain amount of time in the Wastes a person may see certain effects that seem to empower some of their abilities.

Traversing the Wastes while under the influence of Furomantical Radiation can make performing even simple tasks a challenge as the Radiation begins to take hold. However, sometimes it aligns with your intention, and a something you were sure to fail magically succeeds.

## Radiation Die

While affected by the radiation in the Wastes, add a Radiation Die to each d20 roll. The value of the Radiation Die is determined by their level of radiation accumulated from the amount of time spent in the Wastes.

### Determining the Outcome

When performing a roll with radiation, compare the outcomes of the d20 and Radiation Die to determine if the action is viable. There are three scenarios.

#### D20 > Radiation Die

If the outcome of the d20 is greater than the outcome of the Radiation Die, the Radiation Die is added to the roll and success is determined as normal.

#### D20 = Radiation Die (Radical Success)

If the outcome of the d20 matches the outcome of the Radiation Die, the action automatically succeeds.
`Should this be a crit or normal success?` #todo

Get a mantic charge back

If you were rolling a death saving throw, automatically come back up, and get a turn

#### D20 < Radiation Die (Radical Failure)

If the outcome of the d20 is less than the outcome of the Radiation Die, the intended action fails due to the radiation. The consequences of this failure are usually determined in the moment by the DM. However some actions, like casting a spell, outline specifically how the spell backfires or fails.

If you're attacking and get a nat 1 radiation fail, maybe the enemy gets an attack right then.

If the action has a defined Radical Failure outcome, that happens as stated. However, if you radically fail on an action that doesn't have a radical failure outcome, something else may happen up to the GM. Some enemies will have a radiation fail outcome that is triggered when a nearby player radically fails on an action that *doesn't* have a defined radiation fail outcome (e.g. on a roll to hit). They use their reaction to do it, once per round.

If you radically fail on a death saving throw, you mutate and come back up as a horror and attack the other players

## Levels of Furomantical Radiation

The longer someone is in the Wastes, the more Furomantical Radiation seeps into and corrupts them. This makes it more likely an action will fail, but also makes a success more powerful. The value of the Radiation Die is determined by the level of radiation someone has, according to the Radiation table.

## Resting in the Wastes

### Short Rest

Each short rest, the GM will roll the Radiation Die associated with the party's level of radiation, to get an effect from the Radiation Short Rest Table (1-12)

### Long Rest

Each long rest, the GM will roll 1d20 + the Radiation Die associated with the party's level of radiation to get an effect from the Radiation Long Rest Table (2-32)

# Old Stuff

Every long rest spent in [[The Wastes]], the players must roll to see if they are affected by [[The Wastes]] the normal amount, or if they are extra susceptible to it this day.

Every long rest, roll a D20 and a radiation die
The radiation die increases with each level of Furomantical Radiation. If the D20 is lower than the radiation die, a wastes counter ticks up, increasing the likelihood that a horror finds you. However, if the D20 is the same number as the radiation die, the counter decreases by X amount. Maybe the current level of radiation?

### Complications

### "Control"

# Waste Counter #todo

# **Random thoughts** #brainstorm 

However, what I want there to be is like DND has its exhaustion condition. We're like you know if you get exhausted then you have certain detriments and blah blah blah blah blah I really want you to have like a special condition that like the more time you spend specifically in [[The Wastes]], the place outside of the cities where the horses live that kind of stuff in the wastes that the more time you're out there whether there be days whether it be hours, I haven't decided yet. Probably like longer. I don't I don't know. But every day you gain a point of something some some condition and I think I want to be like not where you get to roll to like try to see if you know eat the roll and don't get to get the condition. Just like if you were out there for a certain amount of time, you all get a point of yada yada yada maybe there be a way to like if you maybe you know if you go somewhere specific or you spend a certain amount of time or in a certain amount of time without something then you could gain too and then that could be a role like OK you rolled a 15 you don't gain two but you still gain one no matter what but if you go somewhere in or get you in just something or breathe something or whatever. Then you might pick up two or three points like boom like like that and I want this to be not like exhaustion just like this van on this movements have this happens if you get sick, your dead basically I don't want to be like an instant death thing I want it to be kind of like the wastes kind of taking control and like seeping into you and the way we talked about the magic is that It's obviously a low magic world, but that doesn't mean the world doesn't have magic, it has a lot of latent magic that is not able to be like controlled except for by some of the monsters or horrors that live in the wastes they like naturally just innately because of their biology and what not they can just they can tap into the magic cause it forms and it makes them up and I'm taking it like a more time you spend a waste of more like the way you become, and then to get rid of it you have to like maybe maybe cool I can create like special potions or something like that. Some kind of concoction obviously wouldn't be like a potion like a medical potion but like a concoction like that. An herbalist or an alchemist is made and this could possibly lessen the result of it or bring it down one point or two points just like that and then if you're outside of the wastes, if you take it and I can fill it with surely start It should go away, so if you have four points of whatever it is, you take you take one of these potions whenever you get to the city or you know the city just has a special magic things for you enter it I don't know, but whatever anyway The thing that I want this condition to do is to be detrimental yes because you're becoming more like the wastes and what not but also give it some sort of a boon. I think it would be really cool officially because it is a low magic world.
