As this arrow is shot, it drops a trail of oil (or something else flammable) behind it in a 20 ft line and then lights the line on fire when the oil has run out, cause a line of flames behind it.

Any creature that walks through the fire line or starts there turn "in" it makes a [[Finesse]] saving throw, DC 10 + the shooter's [[Finesse]] or [[Tinker]] modifier #brainstorm #todo, failures take 3d6 fire damage and successes take half damage.

If a creature is hit with the arrow, it takes normal arrow damage and then is one end of the fire line and would be within the fire.
