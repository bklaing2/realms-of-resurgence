[[Arrow]]
Similar to the [[Glyph Ring]], but in arrow form.

Must be made with the help of a [[Scribe]].
[[Tinker]] time increases 2 hours for each order of [[Rune]] higher than 1.
Must still be activated by a [[Scribe]].

Can be shot at a creature to apply a rune to their body, as well at an object or other to apply a rune to it. If a creature is shot by this arrow, they take the normal damage of whatever bow is used to shoot the arrow.

Range on this arrow is less, because of the weight of the runic circle and [[Component]] used on the tip of the arrow. All [[Component]] needed for the desired rune must also be included in the creation of this arrow.
