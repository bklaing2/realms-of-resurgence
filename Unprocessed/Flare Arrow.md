[[Resources/Arrow]]
When this arrow is shot, a bright light and smoke emits from it, causing the area around it to be lit up brightly.
It continues to flare for 2 rounds (12 seconds) and can be seen for miles around if fired directly in the air.

If a creature is shot by this arrow, they take the normal damage of whatever bow is used to shoot the arrow.
