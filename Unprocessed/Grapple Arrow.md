This arrow can be shot at something and it trails a thin, but strong cord/cable behind it, allowing the shooter to either climb what it was shot at, or pull that thing or creature towards it with a [[Fortitude]] check. If shot at a creature, that creature takes the normal damage that the bow would do.

The cord/cable has a length of 30 ft, but that also can change depending on [[Components]] and [[Tinker]] time.

*There are a ton of ways this could be used and it can be left up to the imagination of the GM and players to find more ways it can be used.*
