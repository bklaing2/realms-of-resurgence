Common [[Waste Environments]] of plains combined with smaller hills. Not mountains, but the landscape is broken up by the hills and creatures cannot see for great distances unless they are at the top of one of these hills.
Anything could lurk around the next hill or within the hill the party is currently on. Small caves are quite common and are used as hiding places for horrors.
