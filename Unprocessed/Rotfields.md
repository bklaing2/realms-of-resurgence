[[Waste Environments]]
Home of the [[Rotborne Spawn]], [[Rotborne Feral]], and [[Rotborne Overseer]] who can be found in much larger numbers in these lands. Hives can be found underground and deep in caves where Spawn and Feral are abundant.
Fairly empty lands, warm and hard. Rocky ground with metal pushing out to the surface often.
Rotborne are sometimes willing to trade with travelers who pass through their lands, but other times will hunt them instead.
