Main buildings where [[The Gathering Bright]] live, study, and rule [[Settlement]]s in the [[The Wastes|Wastes]]. Filled with artifacts brought back from the [[The Wastes|Wastes]], [[Potions]] that have been brewed, and more information that any individual settlement-dweller knows about the [[The Wastes|Wastes]] and [[Sai Yoxis]] and the universe beyond it.
The [[The Gathering Bright|Gathering Bright]] control this information and these rare artifacts very closely, wanting to keep the waste-dwellers weak and in the dark.

[[The Gathering Bright|Gathering Bright]] members (need a name #todo ) always burn, destroy, or take things within the Reliquary when they leave it for good - even sacrificing their life to do so. Waste delvers often can find [[Items]], [[Potions]], and other things inside an abandoned Reliquary if they find one when out in the [[The Wastes|Wastes]], but they are almost always the center of horror activity in an abandoned [[Settlement]] due to the residual [[Mantic]] energy around the buildings. Making it a risk to enter the buildings and explore them.

Always having at least one more story as the rest of the buildings around them in the [[Settlement]]s, and almost always holding secret rooms and cellars that are used for extra hiding and experimentation.
