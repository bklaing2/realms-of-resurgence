[[Resources/Arrow]]
Wherever this arrow lands, an explosion of acid spreads out in a 15 ft radius, dousing the area of the circle with acidic liquid. Any creature within the radius immediately makes a [[Finesse]] saving throw, DC 10 + the shooter's [[Finesse]] or [[Tinker]] modifier #brainstorm #todo , or takes 2d10 acid damage. (Successes take no damage) Creatures ending their turns within the radius must remake the saving throw roll.

The jar of acid on this arrow makes its travel range much less than a normal arrow.
