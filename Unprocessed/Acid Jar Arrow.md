Wherever this arrow lands, an explosion of acid spreads out in a 15 ft radius, dousing the area of the circle with acidic liquid. Any creature within the radius immediately makes a [[Finesse]] saving throw, DC 10 + the shooter's [[Finesse]] or [[Tinker]] modifier #brainstorm #todo , or takes 2d10 acid damage. (Successes take no damage) Creatures ending their turns within the radius must remake the saving throw roll.
