[[Waste Environments]]
A rare and magical type of [[tundra]] filled with ancient spirits called Willowflame that float and wander around the landscape, playing tricks on travelers. Frostgems, to make [[Frostgem Flecks]], can be found in generous proportions within this biome, as can powerful horrors hiding in caves and hunting in the snow. The only place to find [[Willowflame Essence]] naturally.
