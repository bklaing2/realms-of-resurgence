[[Waste Environments]]
Dark and shadow-covered, the Shadowgale is a very unique environment filled with dead trees, ancient dilapidated buildings, and collapsing spires and towers; oftentimes connected by small canals and streams.
PCs that find themselves in the Shadowgale typically feel themselves being watched and stalked through the tight corners and streets of these forgotten cities.

PCs have disadvantage on Perception and their torches (and other forms of light) do not penetrate as far as normal.
Dangerous and intelligent horrors spend their time here, and PCs can find many mysteries beneath the surface.
