[[Waste Environments]]
Found all across the continent and in almost every environment. Caverns can be large or small, inhabited or uninhabited, or anything in between. What could be a safe place to spend the night, can very quickly turn into a death sentence.
(Below is less of a cavern and more of a buried city of some sort, but it fits the vibe so I will leave it for now)
