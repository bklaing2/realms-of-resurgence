[[Waste Environments]]
Large statures scattered around the Wastes depicting a large cloaked figure, holding a walking stick and an outstretched hooded lantern that never goes out. Revered by all Waste Dwellers, they provide a modicum of safety when in the Wastes, as horrors tend to give them a wide berth, though not all of them.

Who could have built these? How do their lanterns stay lit? And why do the nightmares of the Wastes avoid them?
