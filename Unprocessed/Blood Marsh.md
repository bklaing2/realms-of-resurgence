[[Waste Environments]]
Marsh that is full of a dark, cold, and viscous liquid (probably blood) that makes it almost impossible to travel through and home to some of the most horrible creatures found in The Wastes. A rare [[Component]], [[Bloodmarsh Vial]] can be found here, and the blood from the Blood Marsh functions for wetting the [[Blood-soaked Chalk]] anytime.

Common for PCs to make [[Fortitude]] saving throws while attempting things here, because of the awful smell.
