[[Arrow]]
When this arrow is fired at a wall or other object, it attaches and begins to act as a torch for the next 30 minutes. It may be put out and relit like a normal torch and provides dim light in a radius of 30 ft.

The weight of the [[Component]] used to create this arrow cause it to have a reduced range.

If a creature is shot by this arrow, they take the normal damage of whatever bow is used to shoot the arrow, plus 1d6 fire damage.
