[[Arrow]]
When this arrow is fired at a creature, it splits into a second arrow right before it hits the creature it was fired at. The shooter makes a second roll to hit (using all the normal numbers) against another creature within 15 ft of the first targeted creature as the split arrow races toward that creature as well.
The first targeted creature takes normal bow damage, and the second creature within range (if the roll hits) takes 1d6 + the shooter's [[Tinker]] modifier of damage.

The weight of the [[Component]] used to create this arrow cause it to have a reduced range.
