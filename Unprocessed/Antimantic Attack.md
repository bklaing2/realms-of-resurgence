Drain a bit of [[Mantic]] energy from a creature on a successful hit. This will weaken the creature (adds some extra damage). The magic is stored as a [[#Mantic Charges|Mantic Charge]], and can be used later.
You may use the stored [[Mantic]] Charge to increase movement or as a reaction to get an attack of opportunity to move with them or keep them there.
