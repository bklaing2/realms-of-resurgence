[[Arrows]]
When this arrow lands or hits something, it lets out a loud sound meant to distract, bait, and/or anything else it can be used for.

The weight of the [[Components]] used to create this arrow cause it to have a reduced range.

If a creature is shot by this arrow, they take the normal damage of whatever bow is used to shoot the arrow.
