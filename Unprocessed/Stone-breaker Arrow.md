[[Arrow]]
If shot at a part or piece of stone or rock that is already weakened, this arrow can punch through the stone to make a "hole" with about a 5 ft radius. If the targeted stone or rock is not weakened, one of these arrows will weaken it enough for the next arrow to punch through.

The weight of the [[Component]] used to create this arrow cause it to have a reduced range.

If a creature is shot by this arrow, they take the normal damage of whatever bow is used to shoot the arrow, plus 2d6 damage. (Any creatures that are made of stone might have some interesting responses to these arrows).
