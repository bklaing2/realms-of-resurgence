[[Arrow]]
When this arrow is shot, it sticks in whatever it was shot at and every 10 minutes drops a little bit of the [[Component]] used to create the arrow. Thus allowing others to follow the trail left by whatever was shot by this arrow (and other interesting things most likely).

The weight of the [[Component]] used to create this arrow cause it to have a reduced range.

If a creature is shot by this arrow, they take the normal damage of whatever bow is used to shoot the arrow.
