[[Waste Environments]]
Rare, strange obelisk-like stone that jut up from the unforgiving landscape out of nowhere. The entire face of the stone is covered in strange runes and other symbols, with unknowable carvings near the middle and top of the structure.
Weird happenings occur in The Wastes near these structures, and even in [[Settlement]]s within a few miles of them.
Powerful and dangerous horrors are drawn to the strange power of these structures and can often be found in the miles around one of them.

Who knows what kind of secrets they keep within?
