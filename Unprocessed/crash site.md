[[Waste Environments]]
One of the rarest locations found on Sai Yoxis IV, a site of a crash of some sort of an ancient transportation device. No one knows what they are or where they came from, but they always can provide safety and powerful [[Resources/Equipment|Equipment]] and [[Resources/Item]] from another world. The safety is only promised once inside however, PCs must first brave the powerful horrors that tend to be drawn to these locations and then they need to figure out how to open these devices.
