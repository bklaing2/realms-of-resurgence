# Combat
## Calculating to Hit
Roll a d20 and add the related **attribute** for the Weapons|weapon (likely your **Intelligence** or **Intuition**)
## Calculating Damage Given on a Hit
Weapon damage + Related weapon **attribute** (**Finesse** or **Fortitude**)
**Critical hits:** normal rolled damage + max damage possible for rolled dice + related weapon attribute
For example, a bow may use Intelligence for the **to hit** number (cause aiming is hard) and **damage** will use **Fortitude** (how strong you are to pull it back).
## Offhand Attacks
Additionally, if you're using a weapon in your **offhand**, you can attack with your **quick action**, but you don't include the to hit attribute score when calculating to hit.

Only specific classes and creatures are able to make **opportunity attacks**, otherwise creatures may move about the battlefield as they wish.
## Armor
| Type   | Required Attributes         | Base AC | Mitigation | Damage Threshold | Damage Slots |
| ------ | --------------------------- | ------- | ---------- | ---------------- | ------------ |
| Light  | +2 Finesse                  | 8       | 4          | 8                | 6            |
| Medium | +1 Finesse and +1 Fortitude | 6       | 6          | 12               | 4            |
| Heavy  | +2 Fortitude                | 4       | 8          | 16               | 2            |

If you do **not** have the required attributes to wear armor, you can still gain the **AC** benefit, but not be able to **mitigate** any damage. You **still** mark damage slots based on thresholds in case you become able to mitigate, it may be broken.
## AC
Finesse + Intuition + Base AC of Armor
## Calculating Damage Received on a Hit
Subtract the **armor mitigation number** from the damage received. If it falls below zero you take no damage. If it falls above the **armor's damage threshold** (before the mitigation), you take the mitigated damage and mark off an **armor damage slot**. Once your armor is out of damage slots, it can no longer mitigate damage, but still grants you its AC score. These can be **repaired** during rests.
**Example:** You are wearing **Medium** armor, your **Finesse** is a +2 and your **Intuition** is a +1. Your AC is a 9. If you get hit for 10 points of damage, you mitigate 6 of that and only take 4 points of damage to your HP.
If you get hit for 14 points of damage, you mark off a damage slot (because it is over your armor's damage threshold) and then mitigate 6 points of it and therefore take 8 points of damage.
## Initiative
d20 + your [[Finesse]] modifier
If in [[The Wastes]], roll the Radiation Die as well. On a Radical Failure, you automatically go at the end of initiative. On a Radical Success, you can choose where you go in initiative order after it has been set for everyone else.

You may choose to roll as a group, where the group of players gets added into the Initiative together at the position of the lowest roll in the group.

Allies that are grouped in the initiative order (rolled numbers next to each other with no other creatures in between) don't need to strictly follow the initiative order. Players may move around their order, take partial turns around each other, and wait for another player in the block to do a specific action before taking their turn.

You also have the option to wait, changing your place in initiative order. This sacrifices your turn in the current round, but you are placed anywhere in initiative that you choose starting the next round.

During your turn, you may take an **Action** (attack, spell, rune, item, or other big action that the GM deems an action), **Quick Action** (offhand attack, focusing on spell, some spells, drinking potion, or other action that the GM deems small enough to be a quick action), and **Movement** (found on your character sheet) which can be taken all at once or broken up.

# Abilities
Realms of Resurgence boasts a plethora of different abilities for you to choose from, and many can be chosen at the times of your choosing, providing customization and variability to each character.

**Passives:** Abilities that are always at use and are given at the early levels of a chosen Ancestry, Class, and Subclass.
**Roleplay:** Ancestry abilities that show usefulness in moments of RP and out of combat situations.
**Combat:** Ancestry abilities that do damage and force a condition on your enemies; increase in effectiveness as you grow stronger.
**Exploration:** Ancestry abilities that help you move uniquely to your ancestry and provide better traversal of the world and the Wastes.

Each of the above abilities are options for you to choose from when you reach levels 2, 4, and 8.

**Class and Subclass Specific Abilities:** 
Each class and subclass also come with their own abilities upon level up. These will be specific to your flavor of fighting and surviving in the Wastes.

# Wastes
*but not much because this will be revealed when they enter the Wastes and we want it to be a secret*
## Radiation Dice
When you have been in the Wastes, you will roll an extra dice along with **any** d20 roll and add it to your roll along with the attributes being added to the roll.
**Radical Success:** When the number on your d20 and radiation dice are the same (no matter the number, even 1s) - like a natural 20, but with something extra.
**Radical Failure:** When the number on your d20 is lower than your radiation dice - like a natural 1, but even worse.
A 20 on your d20 is still a critical, but just not a radical success.

# Resting
## Short Rest
- 30 minutes long
- Can roll a number of hit dice equal to their class level to gain health back, but hit dice only refresh on a long rest.
- Can repair armor with a repair kit
- Some classes can also refresh mantic charges
## Long Rest
- 6 hours long
- Max HP
- Refresh hit dice (only refresh half when in the Wastes)
- Armor can be repaired without a repair kit
- Mantic charges refresh and any stored fade away

Resting in the Wastes is necessary, but dangerous, PCs should think twice about when and where they rest.
