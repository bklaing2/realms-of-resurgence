# Combat
## Calculating to Hit
Roll a d20 and add the related attribute for the [[Weapons|weapon]] (likely your [[Intelligence]] or [[Intuition]])
## Calculating Damage Given on a Hit
Weapon damage + Related weapon attribute ([[Finesse]] or [[Fortitude]])

For example, a bow may use [[Intelligence]] for the to hit number (cause aiming is hard) and damage will use [[Fortitude]] (how strong you are to pull it back farther).
## Offhand Attacks
Additionally, if you're using a weapon in your offhand, you can attack with your quick action, but you don't include the to hit attribute score when calculating to hit.

Only specific classes and creatures are able to make **opportunity attacks**, otherwise creatures may move about the battlefield as they wish.

# Combat 
Rules for attacking
- what they add to hit
- what they add to damage

## Armor
- include that entire armor table from [[Combat]]
Honestly, just most things from that combat page probably
- initiative
- calculating damage

# Abilities
- A list of what kind of abilities they will probably have access to
	- passives from [[Ancestry]], [[Class]], and [[Character Creation|Subclass]]
	- the types of actives they have the chance of unlocking and a short description of what they could be
		- **roleplay** - helps in RP and settings where you aren't fighting.
			- examples: [[Ultrasonic Message]], [[Leaf Image]], and [[Spores]]
		- **combat** - a special ability that your specific ancestry can bring to combat
			- examples: [[Dermal Armor]], [[Autohaemorrhaging]], and [[Slime Trap]]
		- **exploration** - abilities that allow you to move uniquely or otherwise assist while traveling in the [[The Wastes|Wastes]]
			- examples: [[Fly]], [[Bioluminescence]], and [[Burrow]]
		- **class specific** - abilities specific to your class. the core way your class plays and survives the Wastes

## New Rules from dnd
- action, quick action, movement
- anything else different from dnd

# Wastes
*but not much because this will be revealed when they enter the Wastes and we want it to be a secret*
- **radiation dice**
	- when in the Wastes, depending on how long you've been there, you roll an extra dice along with your d20
	- you add it to your d20 roll
	- radical success - when your d20 and radiation dice are the same (no matter the number, even a 1), very good
	- radical fail - when your d20 is lower than your radiation dice, very bad

# Resting
Times and how long it takes, what can be done. things from [[Resting]]
In the Wastes things are different, maybe say there is a table, but don't explain more than that

# Vocabulary
What vocab is *specific* to our game?
- we've already covered the radiation fails and crits
- proximity radiation fails
- mitigation
- damage thresholds
- (might be it tbh)
