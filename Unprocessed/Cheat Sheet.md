# Combat
## Calculating to Hit
Roll a d20 and add the related attribute for the [[Weapons|weapon]] (likely your [[Intelligence]] or [[Intuition]])
## Calculating Damage Given on a Hit
Weapon damage + Related weapon attribute ([[Finesse]] or [[Fortitude]])
**Critical hits:** normal rolled damage + max damage possible for rolled dice + related weapon attribute

For example, a bow may use [[Intelligence]] for the to hit number (cause aiming is hard) and damage will use [[Fortitude]] (how strong you are to pull it back farther).
## Offhand Attacks
Additionally, if you're using a weapon in your offhand, you can attack with your quick action, but you don't include the to hit attribute score when calculating to hit.

Only specific classes and creatures are able to make **opportunity attacks**, otherwise creatures may move about the battlefield as they wish.

## Armor
| Type   | Required Attributes                 | Base AC | Mitigation | Damage Threshold  | Damage Slots |
| ------ | ----------------------------------- | ------- | ---------- | ---------------- | ------------ |
| Light  | +2 [[Finesse]]                      | 8       | 4          |                   | 6            |
| Medium | +1 [[Finesse]] and +1 [[Fortitude]] | 6       | 6          |                   | 4            |
| Heavy  | +2 [[Fortitude]]                    | 4       | 8                              | 2            |

If you do not have the required attributes to wear armor, you can still gain the AC benefit, but not be able to mitigate any damage. You continue to mark damage slots based on thresholds in case you become able to mitigate, it may be broken.
## AC
[[Finesse]] + [[Intuition]] + Base AC of Armor
## Calculating Damage Received on a Hit
Subtract the armor mitigation number from the damage received. If it falls below zero you take no damage. If it falls above the armor's damage threshold, you take that damage and mark off an armor damage slot. Once your armor is out of damage slots, it can no longer mitigate damage, but still grants you its AC score. These can be repaired during rests.
## Initiative
d20 + your [[Finesse]] modifier
If in [[The Wastes]], roll the Radiation Die as well. On a Radical Failure, you automatically go at the end of initiative. On a Radical Success, you can choose where you go in initiative order after it has been set for everyone else. On a Radical Critical, you get a bonus action during your first turn.

You may choose to roll as a group, where the group of players gets added into the Initiative together at the position of the lowest roll in the group.

Allies that are grouped in the initiative order (rolled numbers next to each other with no other creatures in between) don't need to strictly follow the initiative order. Players may move around their order, take partial turns around each other, and wait for another player in the block to do a specific action before taking their turn.

You also have the option to wait, changing your place in initiative order. This sacrifices your turn in the current round, but you are placed anywhere in initiative that you choose starting the next round.

## New Rules from dnd
- action, quick action, movement
- anything else different from dnd

# Wastes
*but not much because this will be revealed when they enter the Wastes and we want it to be a secret*
- **radiation dice**
	- when in the Wastes, depending on how long you've been there, you roll an extra dice along with your d20
	- you add it to your d20 roll
	- radical success - when your d20 and radiation dice are the same (no matter the number, even a 1), very good
	- radical fail - when your d20 is lower than your radiation dice, very bad

# Resting
Times and how long it takes, what can be done. things from [[Resting]]
In the Wastes things are different, maybe say there is a table, but don't explain more than that

# Vocabulary
What vocab is *specific* to our game?
- we've already covered the radiation fails and crits
- proximity radiation fails
- mitigation
- damage thresholds
- (might be it tbh)
