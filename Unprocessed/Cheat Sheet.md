#brainstorm what needs to be included

# Combat 
Rules for attacking
- what they add to hit
- what they add to damage

## Armor
- include that entire armor table from [[Combat]]
Honestly, just most things from that combat page probably
- initiative
- calculating damage

# Abilities
- A list of what kind of abilities they will probably have access to
	- passives from [[Ancestry]], [[Class]], and [[Character Creation|Subclass]]
	- the types of actives they have the chance of unlocking and a short description of what they could be
		- roleplay - helps in RP and settings where you aren't fighting.
			- examples: [[Ultrasonic Message]], [[Leaf Image]], and [[Spores]]
		- combat - a special ability that your specific ancestry can bring to combat
			- examples: [[Dermal Armor]], [[Autohaemorrhaging]], and [[Slime Trap]]
		- exploration - abilities that allow you to move uniquely or otherwise assist while traveling in the [[The Wastes|Wastes]]
			- examples: [[Fly]], [[Bioluminescence]], and [[Burrow]]
		- class specific - abilities specific to your class. the core way your class plays and survives the Wastes

**Basic rules**
- action, quick action, movement
- anything else different from dnd

**Wastes** - but not much because this will be revealed when they enter the Wastes
- wastes dice
	- when in the Wastes, depending on how long you've been there, you roll an extra dice along with your d20
	- you add it to your d20 roll
	- radical success - when your d20 and radiation dice are the same (no matter the number, even a 1), very good
	- radical fail - when your d20 is lower than your radiation dice, very bad
