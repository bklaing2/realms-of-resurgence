[[Arrows]]
When a creature is shot by this arrow, they must make a [[Fortitude]] saving throw, DC 10 + [[Tinker]] modifier, or they become stunned until the end of the shooters next turn.

Stunned creatures are incapacitated and cannot move, automatically fail [[Fortitude]] and [[Finesse]] checks and saving throws, and attacks have advantage on them.

If a creature is shot by this arrow, they take the normal damage of whatever bow is used to shoot the arrow.
