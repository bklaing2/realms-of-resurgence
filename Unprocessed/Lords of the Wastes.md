[[The Wastes]]
the high [[intelligence]], high powered horrors are often known and called gods by the common folk. they aren’t gods (at least most of them aren’t at that level) but they seem like it to the common person.  
they might take goats or other offerings to a nearby hill in the wastes for the “hill god” to be appeased.  
they talk of them as if they are gods, “the god of the north plain” “the god of that large tree” “the god that resides in that ruin”
