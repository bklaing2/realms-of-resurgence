[[Resources/Arrow]]
Wherever this arrow lands, in a radius of 30 ft, no sound can emit from the radius. Any creatures within the radius are unable to make noise or hear noise from outside the radius (or inside of course).

Thus, no spell or ability needing vocal [[Component]] is unable to be used within the radius of this arrow.

If a creature is shot by this arrow, they take the normal damage of whatever bow is used to shoot the arrow.
