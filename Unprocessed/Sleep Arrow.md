[[Resources/Arrow]]
When a creature is shot by this arrow, the shooter rolls 4d6 + [[Tinker]] modifier and if the number rolled equals or exceeds the remaining HP of the creature who is shot, they instantly fall prone and asleep for the duration. If a sleeping creature takes any damage, they are awakened; the same goes for if another creature uses an Action to awake them.

The weight of the [[Component]] used to create this arrow cause it to have a reduced range.

If a creature is shot by this arrow, they take the normal damage of whatever bow is used to shoot the arrow (but does not wake them, damage first, then sleep).
