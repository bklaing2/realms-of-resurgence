# Short Rests
- short rests can be done pretty much at any time
- they last about 30 minutes
- this is time for the PCs to rest, eat, chat, plan, and do some general upkeep
- they get to roll a number of hit dice (the dice each of their classes rolls for HP at level up) equal to their [[Character Creation|class]] level to gain health back, but hit dice only refresh on a long rest
- PCs can repair armor, but only if they have an [[Armor Repair Kit]] or [[Advanced Armor Repair Kit]]
- allow the players to level up
- maybe include a way for players to roll and gain back some of their [[Mantic Charge|mantic charges]]? #todo #brainstorm 

- if in the [[The Wastes|Wastes]], the GM rolls on the **Waste Table** immediately after the rest is over to determine the consequence for the next little while


# Long Rests
- long rests can be done once per day
- last about 6 hours
- similar things as a short rest, except that the players will also sleep and keep watch
- only two watches needed for everyone to sleep (speeds up playtime)
- all PCs heal back up to max HP at the end of the rest (without rolling hit dice)
- hit dice also refresh
- all armor is able to be repaired **without** the use of [[Armor Repair Kit]]s
- allow the players to level up
- players can work on projects during rests like [[Runic Circles]], Spells, [[Potions]], [[Arrows]], and pretty much anything else PCs can think of
- [[Mantic Charge|mantic charges]] fully refresh and any extras that were being held should go away (though, they most likely already overclocked and blew up in a PCs face) even if they were in a magical item
- many magical items refresh

- a long rest **outside of the Wastes** is needed to "revive" someone from dropping after failing their death saving throws when they do **not** have a Scar.

- if in the [[The Wastes|Wastes]], the GM rolls on the **Waste Table** *immediately* after the rest is over to determine the consequence for the next little while

> | _Number rolled_ | Problem that occurs    |
> | ------- |  ----------------------------- |
> | **_1_**     | until the next rest, the party feels like there is another presence nearby watching them |
> | **_2_**     | until the next rest, the party loses their sense of taste to the point that food and water instead taste terrible |
> | **_3_**     | until the next rest, the party sees shadows and hears voices that are not there |
> | **_4_**     | one or more low-low horrors comes within range of the party’s camp |
> | **_5_**     | until the next rest, all ground becomes difficult terrain to the players |
> | **_6_**     | one or more high power-low intelligence horrors comes within range of the party’s camp |
> | **_7_**     | each party members loses two resources (food/water) |
> | **_8_**     | the party wakes up and unknowingly goes the wrong direction, becoming lost in the wastes for 1d6 days |
> | **_9_**     | the entire next day, the dwarf star is not visible within the Wastes, perception and navigation rolls are made with disadvantage |
> | **_10_**     | one high power-high intelligence comes within range of the party’s camp |
> | **_11_**     | everyone's number of [[Mantic Charge|mantic charges]] are doubled, but horrors also double their mantic score and thus double their extra added damage. (if an attack did 2d6+5 damage, it now does 2d6+10 damage) |
> | **_12_**     | the party falls under the sight and attention of one of the lords of the waste |
