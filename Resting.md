# Short Rests

short rests can be done pretty much at any time
they last about 30 minutes
this is time for the PCs to rest, eat, chat, plan, and do some general upkeep
they get to roll a number of hit dice (the dice each of their classes rolls for HP at level up) equal to their class level to gain health back, but hit dice only refresh on a long rest
PCs can repair armor, but only if they have an [[Armor Repair Kit]] or [[Advanced Armor Repair Kit]]
allow the players to level up

if in the [[The Wastes|Wastes]], the GM rolls on the **Waste Table** immediately after the rest is over to determine the consequence for the next little while


# Long Rests

long rests can be done once per day
last about 6 hours
similar things as a short rest, except that the players will also sleep and keep watch
only two watches needed for everyone to sleep (speeds up playtime)
all PCs heal back up to max HP at the end of the rest (without rolling hit dice)
hit dice also refresh
all armor is able to be repaired **without** the use of [[Armor Repair Kit]]s
allow the players to level up
players can work on projects during rests like [[Runic Circles]], Spells, [[Potions]], [[Arrows]], and pretty much anything else PCs can think of

a long rest **outside of the Wastes** is needed to "revive" someone from dropping after failing their death saving throws when they do **not** have a Scar.
